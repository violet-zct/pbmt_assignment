when steve lopez , funny , go to los angeles times , one day through the streets in the center of going to los angeles , i went , i heard he 's a wonderful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , rough , are homeless , on a violin and , the only two strings .
many of you 're going to the story know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , that again <unk> was , robert <unk> junior , when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> studied and of very promising career tragically early by his <unk> schizophrenia , and was .
nathaniel left <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , living it as homeless on the streets of <unk> row in the center of going to los angeles .
i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or the film at , so they 're not just the wonderful , connected to understand that between these two men from this is , but also , like the music that connection to make it and how they finally , the instrument was , if this pun allows is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get .
i met mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a demo of <unk> first and fourth symphony of and came from behind the stage , , me to imagine .
he talked in a very <unk> and <unk> tone of yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers it 's ever in the bigs world series that would . and that all for the <unk> passage of the first violin in the last sentence of <unk> <unk> symphony .
we came to talk about music to talk . and a few days later , i got an email , in the state , that nathaniel , for <unk> at me interested .
i must , say , that nathaniel a medical treatment <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> treated been , a trauma , that it be whole life being .
as a consequence of it is now , especially vulnerable to these <unk> stages . that are sometimes , so bad , and he days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , this horror and the <unk> his own mind to .
and in that a <unk> was nathaniel , when we do with our first class , walt disney <unk> hall , began . he had this 'm flickering in his eyes and it seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible demons and smoke and about how it does anyone in your sleep poison and i wanted .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was scared me to him lose that , that he had one of conditions get could and that i want to its relationship to violin destroy that , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and exciting forms of the <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started doing so easy to play .
i played the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed , that in <unk> eyes a <unk> change in the way .
it was , as if it under the impact of invisible <unk> said , a chemical response , of the catalyst for my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turning to in understanding , in a quiet for curiosity and <unk> .
and how through a miracle , and he shares his violin and started to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then to end to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started then , about music to talk , starting from the stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i became clear , that he 's not just a <unk> know about music owned , but it with you also a tight personal relationship connected .
he spoke of her with a passion and a sense , that i would just by my colleagues in the philharmonic , of los angeles know .
by his music playing and about music back , was from this <unk> , confused man , the right now , through the streets of los angeles to was , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> musicians have become .
music 's medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music that allows it took him , his thoughts and delusions to his imagination and creativity in a real <unk> .
and so <unk> he shares his <unk> states .
i understood , that 's what this is being the art is .
what this is the reason , why we music to do : so we do something , that in us all , deep in there 's , our feelings , by our artistic lens , by our creativity to actually shape can .
and the fact that expression to us all , and moves , inspired , and it unites us .
what nathaniel <unk> , that brought him the music back in a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music got him back in a family of musicians , the him in mind , the be a talent and i realized , and it <unk> .
and i 'll again and with nathaniel music , no matter whether it in the walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me that , why i musicians and i am .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen .
i hope , pardon me .
so i have in my life many fishes <unk> .
i just two loved .
this first , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a fish , <unk> , good it , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what a fish .
still better , he was in <unk> , the supposedly of standards of sustainability from .
you could , so i think that feeling , it to sell it .
i had with this beauty of a relationship of several months .
one day she called the head of the company , and said , if i at one event <unk> could about the sustainability of the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
here was a company , the to solve was trying to , what this incredible problem for our chefs 's become . how to keep going to fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean fish like to forests <unk> did have .
it 's hard , the destruction began to <unk> .
90 percent of the big fish , the , that we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they are totally collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so i will probably , or the evil <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
of arguments against it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , take this tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds <unk> are required , so you a pounds <unk> gets .
not very sustainable .
it tastes , not very good .
so here was finally one company , the tried , it right to do .
i wanted you have .
the day , the event going to the head of the <unk> for the company in .
we call him , don .
`` well , don , '' i said , `` just about the facts , right to have , you are famous for instance , so far out in the sea grow , that you the environment is not being polluted water . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out , that the waste of our fish you will , not quite concentrated . ''
and then we added it 's add , `` we 're in basically a own world .
these <unk> of <unk> to 1 , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one , what ? what an her ? ''
`` sustainable and proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said , put on .
and at that night was i in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i the next day , briefly , the event , don .
i said , don , for example , are sustainable proteins right ? ''
he said , he her that 's not . he 'll <unk> .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could me a proper answers to be . until i finally with the senior biologists <unk> .
we call it also , don .
`` well , don , '' i said , `` what for example , are sustainable and proteins right ? ''
well , he mentioned , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers to the skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and to forage data . ''
i said , `` how much percent <unk> <unk> 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don , what 's sustainable in the chicken , fish to feed ? ''
there 's a long to break in the line and he said , `` there 's easy to a chicken in the world . ''
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not , because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
that i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> actually from this fish <unk> , because , i swear to god , the fish , this entertainment , grilled chicken <unk> .
this second fish , this is a different kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic sort of , the way , at the you , ever better to his fish about learning , you the fish and the more love .
i 've got it first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist who had been long time of this fish were talking about .
it has us a way , <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef who had him <unk> .
hold twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish that well taste and so , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy can it .
we call him miguel , actually means he miguel .
and no , he has the fish , cooked , and he 's not a chef . at least in the way , that you and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
it 's near the <unk> of the river <unk> .
until the 1980s , was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they <unk> <unk> on the , what in basically the wetlands , were .
they did that , by showing you this country <unk> .
they built this complicated result of these channels , and you who water from the land out and beyond the river .
now , they could n't do , that it was fine , not cost-effective .
and ecologically and it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds to , which for this place , many birds are .
and that has 1982 , a spanish company with green the country , bought .
what they 've done ?
they have the river of water versa .
they have literally the <unk> <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> used them the channels , the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , eel that -- and have miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction , completely other way .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have something that still never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , the one million miles away is , and everything what you 're <unk> channels and the density , lush march .
i was there , not long time with miguel .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts by charles darwin and a part `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? because we were and struggled to us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , have mud up to my down , and miguel holding in peace one <unk> .
here 's what he 's a rare <unk> out .
now about it 's the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , see here 's a pattern of <unk> , that it at the <unk> giraffe , it .
it turns to figure out , is miguel most of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , he wants to this is a <unk> 's become .
he said , `` the fish ? i know nothing about a fish .
i 'm an expert of relationships . ''
and then goes , he and plummets , in more <unk> of those rare , birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and you know , i 'm not be wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this <unk> piece <unk> fish , that i the <unk> had .
so i brought him speak broken . i said : miguel , how come to your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed up with the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , that 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
well , he , continues to me tell , that it 's a rich system is , the fishes better food , what you in the wilderness of food were .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , this is what the fish have an .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there 's no food .
and by a farm is , the their animals , it feeds ?
later , the day was i on this property with miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , the way of course it seems to be , '' different than any farm , on the i ever been was , `` how it measures , you success ? ''
in the moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> to have .
and we came to the corner and we provided to the most amazing sight , thousands and going <unk> flamingos covered , a literally <unk> carpet so far the eye is enough .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look out their <unk> on , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> you 're not your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose within 20 percent of our fish and <unk> at the birds .
well , last year were on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 250,000 , different ways .
it is the largest and one of the most private <unk> in , europe has gone .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last , that you on a <unk> have to ? ''
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , not hard .
this is a who network .
the flamingos , and eat the shrimp .
the shrimp , and eat the phytoplankton .
and <unk> so the belly the better the system . ''
okay , let 's that come . a farm , their animals not an and a farm , their success of the health of her to measure .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to these flamingos , first place did n't even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning fly you 240 kilometers to farm .
and every night fly it comes 240 miles back .
they do that , because they the <unk> white line of the highway <unk> , can .
in seriously .
i had to me a journey of the penguins had imagined , so i looked i miguel , .
i said , `` miguel , fly it comes 240 kilometers to the farm and fly , then the 240 miles back at the evening ?
they do that for the children ? ''
he looked at me , when i just a song from the whitney houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that , because the food is better . ''
i do n't have the skin of my beloved of a fish mentioned , delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i do n't you <unk> . i do n't you <unk> .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i cooking , almost never with it .
and yet , when i them in this restaurant in <unk> attempted , she did n't even after <unk> <unk> .
they she sweet and in , as if you a half bites by the ocean , would .
i mentioned that , miguel , and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin it looks like a sponge .
it is the last <unk> , until something in the body into .
they have to the throughout the evolution of evolved to <unk> <unk> . ''
and then we added it 's add , `` but our drinking water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , your fish , not an . a farm , their success is the success of her to .
and then i was clear , when he says , a farm , the no <unk> has , <unk> he shares powerful , because the water , that through this farm there 's coming from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , the all the things with , leads , of rivers , today to have , you with , to lead , chemical pollutants , drain , <unk> .
and if it , through the system fought , and this which is the clean , how it <unk> is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , the their animals , it feeds , not just a farm , the their success on the health of <unk> measures , but a farm , the literally a <unk> is , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'll do it , and that they should also do , because these <unk> , romantic as well , that 's also <unk> .
you might say , you to a recipe is for the future , good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food in fact , taste .
but for many people that 's a little to radically .
we 're not a <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love this little <unk> . we 're talking about regional food . we eat , organic .
and if they claim that the things that the future of good food more about somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how you be the world to feed ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not , because we have enough of calories are producing , the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are today <unk> .
one billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because <unk> inequalities , in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i like this question is not , because they have the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years about this .
these grain of <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , chemicals at the earth , chicken at the fish , and the time has the agribusiness just wondered : `` if we 're more people less feed , how awful it can already be ? ''
this was the <unk> . it was the which . it was the business plan the american agriculture .
we should they call , what it is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> , that , who capital <unk> , that 's exactly the production , it .
this is not <unk> , and it 's not invent agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through the fertile one country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not by the chainsaws , but by the forests , and not by <unk> and nets , but by the fish in the sea .
they want to the world to feed ?
you make us to start with the question : how we 're going to feed ?
or better , how the conditions do that every community to enable , , to feed ?
the to do , look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are at <unk> and it has never been something really good for food produced .
so let 's instead , the ecological model .
that 's this on two billion years <unk> <unk> .
let them . miguel , farmers how miguel ,
facilities , the n't worlds for , are , facilities , that restore , rather <unk> , facilities , the <unk> grow , rather than just hard , farmers , the not just <unk> are , but experts , relationships ,
because they are ones that 's also the experts to taste are .
and when i really honestly , they 're a better chef : when i do it ever be going .
you know , it 's me , right , because if that the future of good food is , it delicious be .
thank you .
if i do you today one thing with want it 's , that the totality of data , that we consume , the greater is as the sum of bits and instead of it to <unk> to think , i want to you think about how we information that can use , that the pattern up and we 're so these trends to see , the otherwise , not visible and be .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> to age arranged .
this program , that i 'm here is , is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do is , i after a certain death filter it , we say , accidents .
and instantly i see a different patterns , that , it .
and it , because in <unk> here the people at the <unk> are and it over here at the <unk> are .
we can one step further out and like the data and new , and see that <unk> and cancer , the usual suspects , are , but not for each other .
if we now go and after the age <unk> , we say , 40 years or a younger , we see that , accidents , even the cause is about the , the people have to make it should .
and who <unk> see , that this is especially in men are true .
you see so that look of information and data in this way , to swim in a living <unk> reminds us .
and if we do this for raw data can do why not , content in itself ?
what we now here are the <unk> every single , `` <unk> <unk> '' that ever printed were .
it 's all here . it 's everything online .
you can put it would like to my talk about in their rooms to test .
with <unk> can you a in a decade .
you can a in a particular year .
you can go directly to a certain copy one .
if i now here , i look , i see the athletes , the in that the appear and the <unk> .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so click i go to make me all spending show in which have lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , when i just a <unk> go get to conclude , could i think , `` okay , what if i got to the subject of walking i look at ? ''
so i one step back and <unk> the way .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that if you on this kind of information on , <unk> , of , <unk> , <unk> , for you do n't know , or <unk> not just .
you do something that actually a little bit different is .
it 's something between , and we think it 's changing the way as information can be used .
i want this idea now a little bit further to do with about what a little bit crazy .
so here we 've done is , we have every single <unk> and you on a little summary reduced .
the summary contains a quick <unk> and a symbol for the area of them coming .
i 'm just the top in the popular <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can a lot of things do .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues , on wikipedia , the popular these are .
i 'm now the issue <unk> '' vote .
well , after i <unk> , who have know , i that the <unk> that the most of <unk> time <unk> `` people of the year , '' are .
this is really important , there is an insight is , the not in a single <unk> 's .
this is just to see if you one step back and it 's .
<unk> on a certain that <unk> i can then in the subject of time <unk> `` people of the year , '' inside , go , and all together to see .
if i now all these people consider know , i , that the majority of <unk> are . some people come from the science . some , still less , come from the economy . it 's my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now to jump , and a look on the ted prize winner and throw away .
you see , we 're surfing the web address the first time as if it also really a net is not only from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want you what else to show what a little surprise be .
i 'll show you here 's just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i want it 's not a browser call it ; it 's not a browser , but you can websites to look -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website , like this .
so i one step back , and directly to a particular unit jump .
this is that matters because you just by that look at the web pages in this way of , all the <unk> on the same way of looking at can .
i can so in my as to zoom in a certain <unk> .
here 's the at the demonstration , that i 'm going to go on .
and i can , everything i now been considered to have , again <unk> .
and , when i went back one step <unk> and on all look , can i mean by the course to organize and maybe , after my <unk> . here , i have to <unk> ' for instance , here , bing , right here to live labs <unk> .
and from here i can in the site into and it back up .
it 's a metaphor , the again and used to , and every time it makes this picture than the amount of <unk> .
the moment , in this world , we think , that 's a curse .
we talk from the curse at the <unk> .
we talk from `` drowning in information . ''
what , if we do this situation around us and the internet on the head , imagine , so that we instead , one of the other to go , start by many things to many things go to , and this pattern of , what otherwise , actually stayed be ?
if we do this can , is this record <unk> , maybe a new source of more information .
and , instead , just in information to move , can we know it to get .
and if we know , then we can maybe even the wisdom that are .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> <unk> science fiction .
in my school , and was i want to the bus to school , every day an hour a way .
and my nose , put it always in a book , a <unk> , that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> in my deep in me , they , voracious curiosity <unk> .
these curiosity that is also in it , that i always , when i 'm not in the school was , through the forests <unk> , around and `` samples . '' and collected , frogs and snakes and the beetle , and <unk> , everything to home to and under the microscope at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was that always the trial , the world to understand and the limits of <unk> .
and my love to science fiction seemed to in my environment <unk> , because then , in the late '60s , went to the moon and they were exploring the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his amazing shows , the us animals and places and a world of wonders they showed that we do n't have can imagine .
and that then , very good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's neither video games have these <unk> with <unk> movies , all the imagery in the media landscape was , i needed the images in my mind make .
that we had at all . if we as kids a book read , we took the description of <unk> and projected them on the screen in our minds .
my response to that was the drawing , and paint by aliens , the aliens worlds , robots , <unk> and all that .
in class , i was always on the teachers get caught , i , <unk> textbook on , <unk> .
the creativity to be some way out .
and that was done something interesting . what makes me , which is , jacques <unk> shows fascinated , was the idea of a us , unfamiliar world here on our earth itself .
certainly would i mean , never an alien world with a spacecraft to achieve . it seemed to me very unlikely .
but here was a world , that i actually enter could , here on the earth , and it was also fascinating and exotic as it all , what i always imagined was , when i those books read .
so i decided , when i was 15 , divers , to be .
the only problem with was , that i in a small village in canada , living , 1,000 kilometers from the ocean away .
it was i do n't <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until he finally , a <unk> in <unk> , new york , for did was , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> in the winter , <unk> , new york .
the ocean but , a real ocean , i received only two years later to face , when we to california doing .
since then , in the 40 years , the now <unk> are , i have about three thousand hours of water spent . 500 hours of them in <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world the deep sea , even the <unk> oceans , so rich in <unk> life is how we it 's really hardly imagine .
the imagination of nature knows is no , in as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to have today , days i feel i then the awe of this , what i on my <unk> see .
and my love to the ocean is , with the same intensity as time and ever .
when i then as an adult along a profession <unk> , it was that <unk> .
it seemed to the best way , my inner drive , stories to tell , with my need , images to create , to unite .
as a child in i always <unk> and so .
so , movies , the way , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
of course , the stories , that i <unk> , from the <unk> , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
so , `` <unk> '' i could my penchant for the <unk> and that dip to the <unk> together .
so intertwined , sort of my two passions .
something interesting happened , `` <unk> '' : to a <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and that is , we had this sort of liquid <unk> create -- , you 're on a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what it came out , was the first computer-generated <unk> , the ever in a film to see it .
the film gave it 's no money one , just being played are he 's for his <unk> a , but i realized something fascinating , the audience on the world was like mesmerized by the magic , of them went down .
according to arthur clarke 's law , are you know <unk> technology and magic does n't know , each other to distinguish self .
they saw so something magical powers .
and that i found it 's exciting .
and i said , `` wow this must have in the <unk> be involved . ''
so we went in `` the terminator , two , '' my next movie , much further .
together with <unk> created we there , the guy from liquid metal . the success of hanging out all of ab , like this effect come to be .
and it worked . again , we had something magical created . and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have to the movie , a little bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences from , was a very new world , , a very new world of creativity to <unk> .
so i was a company , together with my good friend <unk> winston , the to look at the best <unk> and <unk> was . it was called `` the digital <unk> . ''
the idea of this company , it was , the stage <unk> processes with visual <unk> etc . to skip ahead and the same with digital <unk> to start .
that we did then , and <unk> us as a while a competitive advantage .
but in the '90s , what we yet , that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , actually started had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` the avatar . '' written , that the <unk> in for visual effects and <unk> effects in the very new heights push it should , realistic about human , expressive characters , the using <unk> 's been . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world to <unk> be .
but the <unk> put quite beautiful , back . and the people in my company told me , that we <unk> still do n't have the be , that to create .
so , shifted to the and made this is another movie about the big ship , that goes down .
the <unk> i have this as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' i sold it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a passionate film .
secretly , but i wanted to actually the real thing up the titanic ourselves .
so i have the film did .
this is the truth . the studio , i knew that , but not .
i mean , but i 'm convinced , by i said , `` we come to the up . we watched films that is up .
we 're going to it in the <unk> of the movie show .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> you , an expedition to fund .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to that , that the own imagination a reality to make it .
we created and then in fact , six months later , a reality , in the i in a russian <unk> into , four miles of the surface of the atlantic , and i the real titanic , through a <unk> <unk> .
it was no movie , not a high definition from , that was real .
so that 's got me that blew .
and the <unk> that were enormous . we must have cameras and a spotlight , and everything possible building .
and i fell on , very these <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you go up in the capsule , is you in this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope to rescue , is , if you do n't it yourself back to do .
and i said , `` wow this is as well , as if i in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was this obsessed by studying the deep ocean .
anyway by the part , the with curiosity and science to do . it was all . it was an adventure , it 's curiosity . it 's imagination .
and it was an experience , and hollywood would n't give you could .
because you know , i was able to me a human beings , imagine for that we then a visual effect of design were . but i could i did n't imagine what i just outside of the <unk> would see .
at some of the following expeditions i was being in <unk> seen , and sometimes these things that i still never seen before i had , sometimes , things , the all , nobody ever seen before i had , and for the science to the time , when we do you saw , no words , they found was .
that 's got me , right <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i met , then a something unusual decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' said , i , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood , ice on and i 'm going to a while <unk> . ''
and then we started , we ended up to `` <unk> '' , and they were exploring them with <unk> .
we returned to come up the titanic , back .
we took a little robot , that we built were , the a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and to the inside of the ship at , what we 've never did was .
nobody had ever been the inside of the <unk> explored . you 'd still no means that . so developed that we will technology .
well , and there sitting i now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , this <unk> here 's quite similar , and of which i know that once the band and played has .
and i am with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i <unk> it 's actually just , but my consciousness is inside of <unk> .
it felt , as if i physically within the <unk> the titanic there .
this was the <unk> shape of <unk> , i ever have experienced . because before i each about a corner bends , i knew i always been , which is the same in <unk> of <unk> actually would that i <unk> about <unk> had was when we the movie around .
this set it is an exact replica of <unk> of the ship .
so that was a highly strange experience .
they made me this <unk> aware , that you could such <unk> avatars are using and so that own consciousness in the vehicle , in this different shape the existence embarrassed you can .
it was at profound
and may also a small view on this , what might be in a few decades could happen , if you <unk> has , to explore , or other things to do , in all kinds <unk> <unk> , that i as <unk> can imagine .
after these expeditions to we started this , what we down there had seen , really appreciate to learn for instance , these <unk> , where we these an amazing animals saw . that 's sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help of chemosynthesis .
they are not in one on the sunlight based system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the right next to a 500 degrees c 's that it 's survival to .
the same time in i also very much for <unk> , that was again , the <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up at the people , the , for the space in and the with the nasa to do have and in <unk> sit and the right <unk> plan . they 're going to russia , through , the mission that <unk> protocol with the drum and you , fly and then the international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
this was fascinating .
but the end , ran it out , that i <unk> with us in the deep took .
i took them , and <unk> you have access to the world down there , <unk> , <unk> , people , the , for such extreme conditions interested . i took them to the sources , so they look around , samples , and instruments to test they could and so forth .
we turned it documentaries , run , but actually the science , more specifically , <unk> .
so lock , the circle , between my existence as <unk> , at a kid , and of those in the reality .
in the course of <unk> i have a lot of learned .
i have a lot of science learned . but , i think they certainly , a director to also have to , a leader be as a <unk> or so .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i these expeditions <unk> .
because of a certain point i had to tell me , `` what i 'm actually here ?
why i doing this ? what 's about it turns out ? ''
these stinking films to bring us no money .
we play time on the by a . of fame not a lane .
all think , that i was between `` titanic '' and `` avatar '' <unk> and have to me some of nails on a towel the beach <unk> .
i 've all these films , these <unk> , for a very small audience did .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what are you just ?
you 're doing it to the task will , to the challenge for -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , that there 's . you 're doing it of <unk> because , and because of weird and connection , that is , if a small group of people a team is .
because we 've all this with only 10 to 12 people did , the years about worked have . sometimes we were two to three months a row on the lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing the warning about this is that , each other , because you have a task does , that any one explain it .
if you on land back and to say , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and it around , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you on sea , working , '' , then you can the other just do n't explain . this is how to police or at the soldiers , the something together through , and you know , that it 's never met anyone who tell you can .
there 's a link , a each other respect .
when i so back , to my next movie `` the avatar . '' to turn , i tried those same <unk> apply it , which is that you could be a team and respected and , in return to respect , deserves .
it was the dynamic really changed .
because i was so again with a small team on <unk> terrain . we turned out , `` the avatar . '' with a new technology , that it before , not there .
it 's exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years to a real family .
it changed . my way , films to do , completely .
it gave people , the said , we have these <unk> yes , really good <unk> and the planet pandora transport .
for me , it was more a <unk> way , my job to do , the actual process , the , in the result has changed .
what we can so from all the end ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think , at first place is the curiosity .
it 's the most human property .
our imagination is a force , even a reality do it .
and the warning of your team is more than all <unk> this world .
come to me a boy , filmmaker , say , `` give me a advice , i like that can do . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
that get the other for you . do n't it you yourself , bet you do n't want to themselves . but to take risks on you . ''
the nasa has been so a <unk> , `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study to fail , an alternative , because there , i guarantee it 's a faith .
no big endeavor , this innovation insisted , ever been no risk of neighborhoods .
you must be willing to be , these risks on , to take .

now i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and this surprised , maybe something , because , my <unk> at the foundation of the vaccines , and seed is , the things that we 're reinventing and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life to allow them .
but energy and climate is extremely important for these people , just took even more than for each other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years n't grow to . it , we need to a lot , or of rain . the things are , so we change that their fragile environment , not withstand that can .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to the uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a climate thing for you .
and it 's the <unk> for you very important .
the fact is , , if you just from one thing the price down could , to <unk> would energy , by far the most effective .
well , the <unk> is about the time in favor .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> drive the industrial revolution , and even in century . there was a <unk> case in <unk> and so we have the refrigerators , <unk> , we can fully modern materials to and so many things do .
we are so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we the price down -- let us the price in -- to make that we 're going on a barrier , and this barrier on with carbon together .
co2 up the planet and the equation for carbon is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which to <unk> leads , and these <unk> has some very negative to follow . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , the <unk> result , that the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not to be able and so the whole systems <unk> .
well , the exact correlation between a <unk> and the it <unk> <unk> and where the other consequences are , there 's some <unk> , but not a lot .
and there 's safe <unk> about , how bad , those consequences will . but they are very bad as being .
i have the <unk> times asked , `` we have to really , down on the near zero to come ?
does n't the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we 're near zero to come , is the temperature on up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a 3.5 feet high truck , the under a number 3 feet bridge from , to . the you can then sort of it back and they .
so this has to way to the bottom , to zero .
well , we into every year of <unk> , of 26 billion tons .
every american about 20 tons . people out of poor countries , less than one .
the average is it about five tons for everyone on planet .
and somehow we have to change 're , that to zero to lower .
it 's in constant up .
all kinds of economic changes to have it 's actually affects and we need to of <unk> rise to reduction in go and to a reduction in to zero .
this equation , has four factors . a little <unk> . they have this thing left -- the co2 -- , that they 're moving towards zero to get to and this is from the number of people depend on , of the service , that every man in the average use , the average of energy for every service and the co2 , that per unit <unk> will .
let 's so every single factor of them to look and think we , like this in zero to get .
likely to one of these numbers very close to zero to come .
now this is the basic algebra , but we take it 's go through .
so we 've got the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it 's what to 9 billion . the , to 9 billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could that i think about 10 percent to 15 percent mortality down , but the time we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second important factor is the services , that we use .
it involves all , the food , that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> mean , those services , almost every on the planet accessible to do .
it 's great that number up .
in the rich world , in the top one billion , we could probably <unk> do and less use , but in the average is that number of every year go up and , so collectively than double , the number of services , the per person to put be .
here we see a very basic services . there 's going to go home light , so you the homework can read it ?
and these students have n't it , so they go out and reading your <unk> the <unk> .
well , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there are finally , good news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of success in <unk> , in other <unk> , in new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , whose <unk> some of those services let 's about 90 percent down .
in other service , like the manufacture of <unk> , 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the window closes for improvement very much smaller .
overall , if we optimistic is , we get it may be a reduction in a factor , three or maybe even to a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion , maybe <unk> 13 billion tons of gone . and that 's just not from scratch !
we look so the fourth factor of -- and this is a in be -- that 's the amount of co2 , the per unit <unk> will .
it turns to the question , if you that to zero to get it .
if you coal , burning , no .
if you gas and burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> today , co2 , except that renewables , energy and <unk> .
so what we 're going on a global level of doing to , is a new system to create .
we need <unk> .
if i now the term `` wonders , '' is , i 'm not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of many of miracle that contributed .
usually have a deadline , that you have a miracle to a certain date needs .
usually it says , you basically just wrong and some people come , there 's not .
in this case we need to but <unk> give and a miracle in very long time getting ?
now , i asked me , how do i really that <unk> ?
there is a natural <unk> , a demonstration , the notion of people here <unk> ?
i remembered in the last year , when i mosquitos to and sort of liked the people that .
the idea was for you really , tangible , you know , it to people there , the to mosquitos to live .
for energy , i noticed that 's a .
i decided that <unk> of fireflies , my <unk> contribution to the environment , this would be .
here are so a couple of natural fireflies .
you have i 'd insured that they do n't bite . in fact , they will probably wo n't let 's the glass of .
well , there 's all kinds of <unk> like this , but they bring all not much .
we need a solution , either one or a couple of the an incredible scaling up and incredible <unk> . and although it many ways , there , where people and searching , i see really just five , that these big needs can afford .
i tides , <unk> , the merger and better biofuels out .
these afford to be a <unk> contributions and if you better do when i expect , that would be great , but my 's here is , we look at all those five to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because it 's <unk> , because all have significant problems .
so let 's first of the burning fossil fuels in , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you there are doing to , it seems to be easy , but this is n't . you have to all the co2 , that after the burning of the <unk> comes to catch , under pressure <unk> and then some place them and hope , that 's there 's left .
there 's some well , that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to get this is very difficult to be . and one that for the storage of co2 to make , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem there 's the <unk> .
who will it sure ?
who can be able to guarantee , literally , many billions of times bigger than any kind of garbage , you of <unk> and other things can imagine ?
that 's a lot of volume .
so that is a tough <unk> .
when the next thing : <unk> .
the also has three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question after security , that you really feel that , nothing wrong can go , despite the human <unk> , that the fuel not for weapons is going .
and what makes you then , this ?
because even though he 's not very large is , there was a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems , that might be solvable are , and in which you that work should .
the past three of five , i 've summarized .
it 's the renewables , how they often be called .
and also have -- although it is they do n't have fuel needs to -- they have some as well .
for one is the <unk> , that these technologies create dramatic lower than the amount of <unk> .
that are <unk> , you 're talking of you <unk> , a thousand times more area as a normal power .
and <unk> these vents <unk> .
the sun is not all the day , it seems to also not every day and it blows , the wind , not the time .
so you , if you of these vents on what 's a way to have to the energy , in times when they do n't available , to get .
there 's so large <unk> . there 's the challenges in the transmission . if we like , say , that the energy source of the country is , they need not just the technology , you must also with the risk around , that the energy from where different from .
and there is that <unk> .
and in the dimension to show , i 'm all kinds of batteries , that are made , looking at , the to cars , computers , mobile phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i did with the amount of electronic energy , which the world 's using , compared to . i found out that all the batteries , that we now producing , less than 10 minutes of <unk> store would be .
we need so here 's a breakthrough , something that to a factor of 100 times better will be , as the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not as easy .
that happens , if you 've tried , these <unk> sources of saying we 20 percent -- 30 percent of <unk> to bring .
if you to 100 percent of that sustain want , they need an <unk> .
now , where do we go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project , '' ? how we come to the goal ?
what we need are many companies , that it work . hundreds of .
in each of five , which we need at least 100 people .
at you are they say , that are crazy ! that 's good .
i think , here in the ted who are there are many , the , there 's been engaged .
bill , it 's several different companies , under one of a company called <unk> the great <unk> has .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies , the great things do and interesting ways , and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold and i pay for a company , the , may surprise , the nuclear approach to follow .
there 's some innovations in <unk> ; this modular , liquid .
the development has in this industry , some time i stopped , so it 's no big surprise , that a good ideas lying .
that <unk> mean , that you instead of a part of <unk> , the one percent , that <unk> , we decided , the 99 percent to burn , that <unk> .
this is a crazy idea .
but actually you had about how long been thinking , but you could never into machine , whether it would work , but since it modern supercomputers -- there , you this machine and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like out , it <unk> .
and because you do that 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning to the garbage , and you can even the waste of today them as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , burn it 's easy . one thing .
that uranium is <unk> uses , a little bit like a candle .

that solve really the <unk> .
this is an image of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part , the right now you burn it , <unk> so does it <unk> uranium .
that <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts , that we need to move to come .
think we , how we our success to measure to .
how should we have a testament to look ?
well , we go to the goal , that we get to , and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many talk by an 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's very important , that we 're going to get to .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poor countries to be produced , and still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement until then clean .
so , these 80 percent to reach , to the developed countries , including the countries like china , their <unk> completely <unk> .
the other note she says , whether we the <unk> technology will , if you in all the developed countries used is , and we on the path is , you to the rest to get .
that 's great important .
this is a <unk> this <unk> .
if we from there back , how should 2020 testament to look like ?
it should be back the two elements of contain .
we should be the <unk> use , the reduction on the way to bring . ever , we <unk> , <unk> low is the <unk> be , and so , the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we companies that do n't completely to the big <unk> lead , just the same , or even something less important as the other , which the <unk> the innovation for this amazing breakthroughs that .
this amazing breakthroughs , we need to deal with <unk> track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's many great books to this issue .
that al gore book `` we have the choice . '' and david <unk> `` <unk> <unk> <unk> the hot pockets air . ''
they go it really , and create a frame , in the this wide , discussing can be , because we need to support of all sides .
there 's a few things that come together .
this is a wish .
a very <unk> wish , that we do this technology making .
if you to me just a desire for the next 50 years to allow , i could the president to choose , a vaccine , and that i love , i could this desire to vote , the question is , <unk> <unk> no carbon being invented . this desire to take me .
this has the biggest impact .
if we this desire does n't get , will of digging between the long term and short term now people are terribly be , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich countries . and almost all life of these two billion are very much worse be .
what we have to so do ?
for what we <unk> i ?
we need to for more context in .
if countries , in places like <unk> meet , you should not just about carbon to talk .
they should those <unk> talk , and they were shocked by the ridiculous , this money , for that cutting-edge approaches spent be .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> & trade something that a <unk> going to make .
we need to the message out .
we need to conversation was and the entire lead and also the things , the amount of the government has done .
it 's an important for instance , but i think , we can give him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . just to <unk> something better to understand -- first , you can make us an idea of magnitude of investment , there ?
bill gates : the simulation in a supercomputer to do , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we need just some 10 million . and even if we have our materials in a russian reactor tested have to ensure that 's about works , is you just in the <unk> million .
the tough step is that build the first <unk> , another billion to find that <unk> and the place of fact , the first of them .
once the first done is , if he was that 's like i promised , everything is very clear , because the <unk> , the <unk> is so different than at <unk> , how we know them .
the right to understand : that means the deep in the floor to almost like a vertical pillar nuclear <unk> , this <unk> <unk> and then starting to the process , up and works , on up to the bottom ?
bg : exactly . now you have to the reactor , new into , so there are many people and many <unk> to go wrong to this thing where you get it opens and things <unk> or going . that 's not good !
if you , but very cheap fuel , you can tell him for 60 years into -- think about a pillar -- you 've been buried , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and <unk> 60 years long and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution for the garbage is .
bg : yeah . now , what to the garbage is happening : you can give him sitting , let 's -- there 's much less than waste , with this method -- then take it and grab him in the reactor and burn it on .
and begin , by we the garbage take , the already exists , the in these <unk> or <unk> at the reactor is . it 's our <unk> .
so this is , which for these reactors operate a problem was , that , what we in our fill and this is that <unk> dramatically reduce during this process .
but while you with different people this world of these are actually have ,
where is the biggest issue , so what really do ?
bg : so we 've still not on a place so , and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is wearing . there 's big interest and the people of the company was in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the energy met , and talking about it , like this to <unk> does .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese who have something in the direction .
this is a final one thing that was done .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster the reactor and some countries have this is built , why is everybody , the a rapid reactor which has , a <unk> for our first .
in their idea : <unk> and the probability that really the life to shout out ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that , which are , we have 20 years to make up and then 20 years to use .
this is sort of the deadline , that 's the <unk> show you have , that we <unk> to .
and you know , <unk> , if anything good is , and that 's a desire to be that easy to hold .
and fortunately , you have today , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds , the , as well , when their approaches work , the funding for their pilot can work , for <unk> can .
and it would be the best , if it 's several create , because then you could be a mixture of use .
, we need a solution .
about the big one of major breakthroughs , this is the biggest , that you know ?
bg : a <unk> is that <unk> .
that would it , without the <unk> been , but that makes it still so much more important .
in a nuclear sector , there 's another , innovative companies .
you know , we know whose work , not as well , like this , but there 's the standard modular way , that 's a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something hard to , but you might say that 's about us .
and so there are different , but this beautiful it is a <unk> a million times as much energy , like , we say a <unk> and so , if you with the problems around you can and that are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , he plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a own league players .
if it does n't , what ?
we need to <unk> stem , to try , the <unk> robust to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation is , it 's as if you to be much eating has , and just a heart is . what do you then ? you need to be a <unk> or anything like .
there 's a <unk> the . <unk> called , the , with various techniques , is about , the warming , to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer and to us <unk> .
that 's just a <unk> .
you hope that we do n't need .
some people say , you should n't just at the insurance to work , because of this may be lazy you 're doing , so you to eat , because you know , that one of the <unk> save them will .
i do n't know , if that 's smart , is , if you to the importance of this problem , but leads , but there 's now a discourse in <unk> about , if you that 's available to have to , if the things faster , coming , this innovation longer need , when we expect .
deniers like , you have a or two sentences for the in , you may have to convince ?
bg : well , unfortunately , in the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the ones , the scientific arguments that do , are very little bit .
they say , that 's negative effects , there , the with the clouds to do have , the things here ?
there 's , very few things that they all say , of which it 's a chance in a million there .
this <unk> here is similar as with aids .
you do the mistake now , and you pay for this very much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all kinds <unk> problems has , in something to invest , of you only later , what 's -- and to come , that the investment has not that is clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst scenario and there 's people in the rich world , the the ipcc look and say , okay , that 's not a big drama .
the fact is , this uncertainty of us about making it should .
but my dream is , that , if you put it , economic can do , and at the co2 and cleaned , say , the skeptics , `` okay , it 's interested me not , that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish i almost , that it 's doing , but i 'm going to it would accept , because it 's cheaper , is as the previous one way . ''
and that would be your answer on the <unk> <unk> argument that , if you all this time and energy use the co2 problem solving , all the other goals , suffering , the <unk> , the fighting of malaria and so that 's a dumb waste of resources , is , money for it to invest , while it better stuff there , we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for the research -- we say the u.s. to 10 billion per year , spend when they do today -- that 's not so dramatically .
it should be other things do n't suffer .
you come then to the great <unk> , and here to make reasonable people <unk> , if you something has , that 's not economic is , and tried , that to fund . for me is happening here the most of waste .
it 's because , you is very quickly with a <unk> and funded the only the curve . i think we should be more things are trying to the potential to have , very much cheaper to be .
if the <unk> , you get , a very high <unk> is , you can only the rich and keep up .
i mean , any of us here to be five times as much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> think about .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research , no more talking about ? ''
he will still , because of its former stories , with the <unk> associated , but he has understood , that a very lonely , who is , and therefore , which he now that <unk> .
and that 's a <unk> , i 'm going to appropriate think .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little bit of which is .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i 'm really , that you wish that 's going . you , thank you .
bg : thanks .
some years ago , here at ted , and peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is pretty straightforward . <unk> to the then <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about . <unk> tape , about . <unk> thread , and a marshmallow , building .
the marshmallow to on top be .
and , though it really just like , it 's actually really hard , because people is very quickly work together .
and so i thought that an interesting idea is , and i put it in a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since i 've been talking about 70 workshops worldwide who did , with students , <unk> and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something at this task , what 's some in the nature of this allows and i want some of them to share .
usually on the most people , even in the task to orient .
they 're talking about , you think that look like this is , they <unk> to do ,
then on them a little time in planning and organization . they 're drawing and put <unk> .
they invest in a lot of their time in the <unk> time <unk> structures
and finally , just before they do n't have time , have to take anyone in the marshmallow and they put him gently down on the top , we step one step back and `` <unk> '' ! i admire them their work .
what but then , almost always , what happens is , that `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is , because the weight of <unk> does , that the whole thing . <unk> and <unk> .
there 's a series of people , the more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have more than others , and the worst are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there 's also the team that much more <unk> '' <unk> have and under the best are totally fresh alumni of the <unk> .
and that 's pretty amazing .
like us , peter told to make it 's not just the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask , is : how does that ? why ? what about that ?
and peter telling : `` none of children spent time in the head of the <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they invest , no time in <unk> .
but there 's still one another reason .
and it , that <unk> trained by , the one right plan to find , ok !
and it , then to realize .
then what happens when you the marshmallow for the top grab , you have no time , and what ?
it 's a crisis .
it sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently is they with the marshmallow and start and prototypes to build , successful prototypes , with the marshmallow , the top , so that they times the opportunity to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
<unk> recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt to get the children 's the feedback , what works and what do n't .
this is the performance , prototypes to work , much -- but we see again , how different teams operate .
the average for the most 's about <unk> , <unk> create the half of lawyers do something more , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
<unk> is the ultimate , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles , understanding and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make stable structures to build .
ceos are about average . but here 's interesting .
of you , we administrator at the team , you 're going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see , to and see , `` this team is going to win . ''
you can predict . why is that ?
because they particular skills of the <unk> .
they run the process , you understand him .
and that team , that <unk> and on the work of attention to the performance of the team dramatically improving .
<unk> skills and <unk> and the combination of lead to success .
if you 10 teams have , the typical 're going to get you ca . six , the robust structures .
i tried so something very exciting .
i thought , we bring the <unk> same .
so she offered to a <unk> dollars a price of software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone a <unk> of construction , we have , he have the price to home by .
it 's so interesting to high <unk> a strong effect have ?
we would this exercise with the students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood it the benefit of `` <unk> . ''
so from the same , for team of them under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the slightest time .
it 's so <unk> lessons for us , about nature of propulsion system and success .
you might ask : why would anyone in fact that time to invest in a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to create , teams to help , cars , video games , `` <unk> <unk> '' to create .
and what the <unk> do is , it helps them hidden assumptions to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or . <unk> , the right prototype stage to build .
and this is the value of experience , this is so simple exercise .
and those of them , that 's interested , can <unk> go .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the <unk> building .
it 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples from all the world , how people that system to optimize and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is that construction , actually a <unk> sports is .
it demands , that we all our senses in the task to focus and , that we think about the optimal use , how our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the amount of us is .
and sometimes is a small prototype this experience anything , what it , us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' moment to bring .
and this can a big difference do .
thank you .
we do so when we have this one machine ,
a machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a time .
and everybody in this room must be in .
and they can in the past , go , you can in the future , go ; they can not in here and now to stay ,
and i wonder , what they vote would , because i my friends in the last time , often that question to have , and they wanted everybody in the past , go .
i do n't know . they wanted to the time , before the cars , there or twitter or `` america for the superstar . ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you some way to nostalgia , to <unk> <unk> is .
and that i understand .
i 'm not part of this group , i must say .
i do n't want to the past , and that 's not , because i 'm a explorers i am .
it 's because it , that are on this planet does n't go back , you go forward .
i want to be so in this machine , and i want to the future , go .
this is the greatest time , it ever on this planet , there , whatever , what scale , they make : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there 's never before a time , like this .
my <unk> died of when they were 60 were .
my grandparents , who this number on 70 .
my parents are the kind of the <unk> .
there was so much better a nine the verge of my <unk> stand .
but it 's not to people like us , because this is a lot more thing than that .
a kid , that today in new delhi , born will be able to expect , so long to live as the richest man on the 100 years ago .
think about it . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox have a billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of the earth in a way to shaped , how it 's no war , ever done .
they are the way . they 're gone .
we have you <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world there 's disease , the millions of us only one generation , threatened to have , there 's still .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
i know all , somebody , what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability , billion people to feed , that are both successes the scientific method .
and from my view is the scientific method , things out , look , whether it works , it will change , if it does n't that does , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that is the good news .
unfortunately is that all the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often mentioned ,
and one of this is , despite all of our greatest achievements a billion people on this world every day hungry , to bed , go .
this number up , and they are rising very quickly , and this is to .
and not only that , we have our imagination to be used , this world had to your .
drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and it soon , and if we 're not from this chaos <unk> disappear , we also .
so the question is : we can do that ? i think it .
i think it 's clear , that we food can produce , the billion people feed them will , without the country , on the they live , to rape survivor .
i think we can this world with energy to feed , they 're not at destroyed .
i think that really , and no , that 's not <unk> .
but this is me at night up -- of the things that me at night up to hold . we have the science progress , never been so desperately to like now , still never ,
and we were also never in the able to him about <unk> , like it today can .
we 're at the threshold to see , an events in many places . and yet , i think really , we hundreds , 300 years ago that i go back to have , in a time to find , in the we progress fighting have , in the we about these things <unk> <unk> have on , more got a now .
the people <unk> , in their trust , which is so closely , that you 're not free can .
not the truth will you free .
and hear them , everybody has a fairly in its own opinion ; even a fairly in its own opinion , for progress ,
but you know what they 're not right ?
they have no right on their own facts . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while it , the figure out .
ago , about a decade , i have an article about , vaccination , `` the new yorker , '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed , on the resistance to hit , on the resistance to the , what the end of the most effective activity in health in the history of humanity 's .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did you know what i always doing , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon after that i wrote an article about <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people were crazy .
so i 've also about an article written , and i could n't understand , why the people thought , that would `` <unk> '' , why they thought , that the molecules on a specific than a random kind <unk> a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i 'm doing what i 'm doing . i wrote the articles , i did on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we type , we 're rich , we go food , that 's okay .
but this was made me to care , and i could n't figure out , why , and eventually i found it turns out .
and that it 's because , these <unk> , the me nuts were actually does n't even <unk> were .
that were <unk> people , educated people , a decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me so what i ...
but then i thought , you know what , are we 're honest .
we 're on a point where , at the we 're not the same relationship to the progress of how they used .
we 're talking <unk> of them .
we 're talking ironic that , with a little <unk> about , `` the progress . ''
okay , that there 's the reasons , and i think we know , which the reasons that are .
we have this faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science at the lost , and there 's no reason , why that 's not that should be .
you can just a couple of the name call and the people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can put your list vote .
there 's ask , and problems with the people , of which we believed that they always right to have . let them to be skeptical .
imagine you ask , for you have evidence that urge you evidence .
take it 's nothing more than any given to .
but now , here , if you evidence to get you have to this evidence to adopt , and it , we 're not good .
and i can it out of the reason to say , that we now in an epidemic of fear of life , i they still never seen have and hopefully will never again , you 'll .
ago about 12 years was a story posted , a terrible story , the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine appeared in the connection to .
very <unk> .
of studies have been done to see if that was true .
of studies to be done to be ; it 's a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in looking out of the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all together , any correlation , no link , does n't even .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we of anecdotes that we think , we think , what we see , what we 're going to see that we think , what does , that we really feel .
we do n't think of a bunch documents from one <unk> , the us data , there , and i understand that , i think , do that we all .
but you know what ?
the outcome of it was <unk> ,
<unk> because of the fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , in the immunization , <unk> down .
that 's absolutely scandalous and we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happened that we do that could .
well , i understand that . that i do i .
because it 's here somebody <unk> ?
has a single in the audience ever get to <unk> to see ?
it 's not very often .
what happens in this country do n't , but the 160,000 time in the world in the last year .
that are many deaths from <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because it 's not happening here is , we can it crowd , and people like jenny mccarthy , can walk around and the messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms like the oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation was not connecting .
they do n't , that these things right to seem , but almost never been the same .
and that 's something , that we learn to , which is very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
it liberated us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , no moons , polio , phew , gone .
the guy in the middle , not so you .
he is paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> evolved .
he can the lives of <unk> , 500,000 in children per year in the developing to save .
pretty well , not ?
so , that 's good , besides that , that paul <unk> and over vaccines talking and says , how valuable they are , and that people just quit ought to complain .
and that he says , in fact that .
paul 's a terrorist .
if paul in a public <unk> talks , he ca n't without being armed <unk> statements .
he gets calls to home , because the people ask him to tell , that you know where his kids to go to school .
and why ? because paul a <unk> has done .
i need that does n't say , but the vaccines are essential .
you take it continues , let the disease , terrible disease , and this is happening now .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and this is worse , and pretty soon be children back to it will die , because it 's just a question of the numbers .
and they 're not just to <unk> die .
, what polio ? we take this . why not ?
a <unk> of me has to me a few weeks ago i wrote , and told you think i 'm a little to <unk> .
nobody has that ever before i said .
they would their kid 's not against <unk> get . on is no way .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't <unk> . and you know what ?
we had in this country , yesterday , no <unk> .
now , i do n't know , maybe she now this morning , somebody in lagos , in a plane and going on to go to los angeles , the moment he 's kind of ohio .
and in a few hours , lands , he and <unk> a car , and he comes after a long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> today , tonight to visit .
and he does n't know , that it with a <unk> disease infected is , and we know that 's also not , because it works the world now time .
this is the planet , on the we live . they do n't so , as if he did n't that 's .
we love it , us in a lie to <unk> . we love this .
you have today morning everybody their vitamins had taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you on the can help .
i know , that they 've done , because half the americans , that every day of power .
you take this stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it does n't matter , how often we find out that they 're useless are .
the data will give the time .
they <unk> their urine . do more they almost never .
that 's okay , they want to 70 billion dollars to dark urine numbers .
i agree with them , to .
dark urine . dark .
why do that ? why do that ?
well , i think , i understand -- we hate the industry .
we hate a to a strong government . we have no faith in the system .
and that we should also not . our healthcare system 's mies .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves to us , that it . can afford .
we go so that way , and you walk , we ?
we walk in the the <unk> .
that 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it 's really a serious business , because that stuff is crap , and we give a billion dollars for it out .
and i 've all kinds of little some here .
n't matter of -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because i wo n't even what that is , but we give a billion dollars for , it 's <unk> .
and you know what ? when i think that i say , shouting at me the people in and say , `` what looks after it you ? let the people , but do , what they want .
so you feel , well . ''
and you know what ? they 've been wrong .
it because i do is , if it is the health is , the says , `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of experts to mammography does n't think , '' or any <unk> , of his patients with <unk> do you want .
if they 're on this way down , where i think , and the magic of evidence and science to replace , getting them to a place , at the they do n't be want .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he got 400,000 of people to , because he thought that was , that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs are , of which we know , you to the course of aids , then we can .
hundreds of <unk> deaths in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> will .
tell me , please do n't that these things do n't have consequences will have .
the have you . that they 've always .
well , the <unk> epidemic , in the we just are , is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about the metaphor .
that 's anti-israeli ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everybody brussels sprouts , by the people changed .
you know , there 's not <unk> in paradise .
there 's no <unk> .
there 's no christmas . we have this all done .
we have it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of it 's work and some of it 's not .
we 've got rid of , what do n't work has .
now we can it in doing . and of course there 's the risks . but we can do something like vitamin a , in rice , do , and this stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to extend .
that you want to do n't do ?
i have to say , that i understand that i do n't .

why do we do it ?
so what i always listening is : too many of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want to the huge areas with one thing that 's wrong .
we do n't that companies alive patent .
we do n't want , that companies seeds have .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they 're right . fix that we .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but it 's not science .
that has with science nothing to do .
it 's right , morality , <unk> .
you know that the science is not a company is .
it 's no country .
it 's not just an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works , he and sometimes not , but the idea , that we the science is not allow you should , their work to do , because we 're afraid of this is a really dead , and they 're holding the millions of people from a flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to 70 percent more food grow to , as the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
a . a .
they need that , and we give it you do n't .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people do encourage , this <unk> stuff to eat , for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch calories . it 's mies .
it 's not require nutrients , it 's not a protein , and scientists building this is all right now in a .
and then you could be the people the food and would n't be blind be .
they would n't starving , and what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything , what i 'm going to say it is : why being we do it ?
i mean , we ask : why being we do this ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about , the genes <unk> . it 's not to chemicals .
it 's not our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> on more food , better food , unique food .
it 's not the rice <unk> , it 's about , people on your life to get , and it is highest time , to understand , what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do , if we so on doing as far do we 're going to a bit guilty of the we i believe , not guilty want to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description for that , what happened here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we need to the really stop .
after this incredible , funny entertainment , you want so you might say , you still in this ridiculous time and the future , go ? ''
, . that i want , .
the moment is it in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can this time on all imagine , what we want .
we can you <unk> , where we 're <unk> want , and we 're going to move , where we want .
we need to those conversations have , and we need to think , but if we in the time up , and the future , we will be happy to be , that made .
i know , that we do it can , and as it takes me in this is something , what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time interested , i for the <unk> . it may strange that , that is a magician that interested , it 's because , you look at it as i , `` a deception , the to a real is , if someone just , enough that thinks . ''
other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect that , the <unk> , and it 's just so , because the person thinks , with her going to be a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> example , there , if the patient 's a enough that thinks a measurable effect in the body that the <unk> called .
a delusion is going to a real , because somebody 's the world .
so we 're also understanding , i want you now a basic , very simple trick to show .
and i 'll show you , he works . this is a trick , the least for the 1950s , in every <unk> for children 's .
i even have him from <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s , learned .
i 'm going to him for them out and it , and explain .
and then i 'm going , why i 'm going to explain .
so , what happens .
that knife , that they 're going to ; my hand , they 're going to .
i 'm going to the knife , just so in my off .
i <unk> my sleeve , back .
and to ensure that , nothing in my sleeve away , or from him out , i 'm just my wrist , right here <unk> .
on this way you can see , that , to none of time , you move . long as i 'm here <unk> , i ca n't in my sleeve hiking , or out .
and the goal of it 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my bare physical <unk> <unk> .
it sits actually so , at its place , that i do it shake it , without that knife <unk> .
nothing goes in my sleeve , or it comes out , no <unk> . and they can all study .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick , i often a little kids <unk> , the , for magic interested , because you can and very much about being able to learn , if you more specifically looking , though it 's a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of you here in the room watching this trick .
he works here .
i think that knife in my hand .
i tell me to my wrist <unk> to ensure that nothing in my sleeve away , or out , and that 's a lie .
the reason why i my wrist <unk> , is that at the real secret of the illusion is .
in the moment , which , where i mean by hand of you <unk> , with them from the back to see , moving . of hands on here , my <unk> , just from there , where he was , in a position , in the he was so <unk> is .
wonderful trick ?
back there is someone , the not a childhood had .
so , he 's here . right .
and when i 'm <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about it , why that a delusion is , why you do n't the world , that down here just three fingers to see are , because the mind , and the way , he information into , they 're not one counts , one , two , three , but it as a group can see .
but that 's now here 's actually do n't . and open , i mean by hand .
of course it 's <unk> , but not by the <unk> my body , but by a trick , through my <unk> , now there is .
and when i mean by close to happen the same thing , by i <unk> , going through this movement 's that the finger , again <unk> .
i take these hand away . and there is the knife .
this trick , they can your friends and the neighbors who demonstrate . thanks .
well , which has this with the <unk> to do ?
a year ago or so , i read a study , that i really blew .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so i was that for me an amazing thing .
it has , which is what turned out , if you a <unk> in the form a white pill offer , in the form a <unk> , it 's just a round , white pill , the one any measurable effect .
but if you the shape , in the you that <unk> give , for example , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue dyed , and a letter that <unk> , it 's actually , measurable more effective .
and that , no matter of any pharmaceutical -- it is just <unk> .
but a white ball is not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really freak .
it turned , but it turns out , that still not everything is .
if you capsules take , are the still more than the pills , every form .
a colored the capsule , the in one of the yellow and the other red is , is better than a white capsule .
also the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not so good as three pills -- i 'm now not by the statistics , remember . do i 'm sorry .
the key , but is ...
... that 's also the <unk> play a role .
and the form of a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to conclude , you have to the needle in your grasp .
right ? an injection with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance that one of patients into .
this is a very powerful image in the head . this is very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to you a different times show , if we have a <unk> .
the fact , is that the white pill , not so good does like the blue pill , not so good does like a time capsule , not so good does like the needle .
and none of has some really have pharmaceutical property . it 's only we think it , the in us a stronger effect <unk> .
i want to know if i do this idea for a trick to be .
i 'll do something that , obviously a delusion is , and let 's really look .
we know , yes , at the study , that you to the needle in them to , if it to the thing to go to .
this is one of two long <unk> . it 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going to you first of a little <unk> .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin stick and through them through push , until you on the other , again <unk> .
if you an evil to -- if they easily in <unk> fall -- i have this a few friends , the last night in the hotel demonstrated , and some people , that i did n't know , and this is a woman , almost <unk> become .
i 'm so , if you very quickly , and evil , is , then you look for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> part here in the back to do .
you can it to see , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it 's so , right here , where my flesh to start , the bottom part of my <unk> i 'm just a little <unk> do .
do i really sorry . does it 's crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other way back out .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we the <unk> had .
about .
but now , they can my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , i 'm going to you show you . that 's a , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know , what the people think , if you see that .
they say , `` okay , the 's certainly not so stupid and <unk> , even the skin , just to us a few minutes long to talk . ''
well , then i 'm it to show you .
look like this from ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and the people back to say , `` okay . i did n't that really seen . ''
the people in the <unk> are now in .
let it to me give them from the close to show .
it 's my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can that <unk> .
so i 'm sorry . if you an evil , is , look away , look n't go .
the people back or the , that later , once in the video to see , will say , `` well , this is yes , fairly impressive , but if it really would , would he -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it really would , it would bleed . ''
okay , let me a little bit of blood for you <unk> .
yes , this is it .
normally would i now the needle take .
i would my arm safe and show you , that 's not the wounds .
but i think , in this on here and with the intention , from a deception something real to do , i 'm going the needle just in there 's and so from the stage go .
we 're going in the next days , a few times the face .
i hope , you look forward to have to that . thanks .
everybody talks about today , on happiness .
i have some people the number of books are so that , `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years out , and they gave , about 40 , and there was still much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest of happiness , explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people happy to do .
but despite all of flood of work , there are several different cognitive fall , it , almost impossible to do , clear about happiness , thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive into action .
this is true of <unk> , the about their own happiness to think , and it is true of scientists , the lucky to think , because , it turns out , that we just so what are like each other .
the first of falling is a <unk> , complexity , admitting this .
it turns to figure out , that the word `` happiness is simply not a useful word , is , because we do it on to many different things can use .
i think , there 's a particular meaning , on the we do it just could , but in large , and all this is something , that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated perspective on to that , what well-being is .
the second case is a <unk> of experience and memory , in which is made them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life , or happy with his life .
and those are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's the <unk> fact , that we 're not about a fact that think that , the well-being of all , without its importance to warp .
i mean this is a real cognitive trap .
there 's simply no way , it right to get .
now i 'd like with an example start by someone , that one <unk> had to one of my lectures , of a story told . [ unclear well , he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and all the end of recording there was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it to , really quite emotionally , that has the whole experience ever ruined .
but that did n't it .
what it ruined had been the memories of the experience .
he had the experience i had .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
they <unk> not because it with a memory <unk> was ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all what he to keep getting had .
what 's actually says is , we about us and about other people think we could in the sense of two kinds of self .
there 's a <unk> myself , that in the presence of lives and the present know , capable of this is , the past , back to experience , but in basically just the present .
it 's the <unk> myself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor , asks : `` do now it hurts , when i do you here <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> myself , and that <unk> itself is that , that <unk> and the story of our lives in one , and it 's <unk> , that the doctor <unk> by he the question is : `` how you in the last time to feel ? ''
or `` what was their journey to albania ? '' or so similar .
this is two very different entities , that <unk> ourselves and that <unk> myself , and the two to confuse it 's part of <unk> of <unk> from happiness .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts really begin with a basic reaction in our memories of -- it begins immediately , .
we tell you 're not just the stories , if we can do , stories to tell .
our memory , tells us stories , that means , what we of our experiences , keep to 's a story .
and let <unk> with an example , start .
there 's an old one study .
this is real patients , the , a painful procedure put them .
i 'm not the details to go . it 's now is no more painful , but it was painful , as this study in the 1990s , who did was .
they were asked , all of 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that your records .
and they 're wondering : `` who by both have more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient to b 's clearly , suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had a patient to b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : how much thought about these patients that you suffered none ? ''
and here 's a surprise ,
and the surprise is , the patient is a , a lot <unk> <unk> at the <unk> had a patient to b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very , where a part of the story is , how it ends up --
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is that kind of ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the , the worse is was the , where the pain of the end up at its been . it 's a bad history .
how do we know that ?
because we have these people after their <unk> ask you have , and too much later , `` how bad , was the whole thing overall ? `` well ,
and it was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
well , that 's a direct conflict between the <unk> ourselves and the <unk> itself .
from view of <unk> even had to b , clearly a <unk> time .
well , what you with the patient is a , could do , and we 've actually clinical experiments done , and it 's made been , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a to extend by showing you just the up in it makes no to very to him to <unk> .
this is going to lead , that the patient is suffering , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes long , makes you have that does , that <unk> ourselves from the patient is a bad on is , and you have that does , that <unk> ourselves from the patient is a lot better on is , because now , you have the patient is a , a better story about his experience , there .
what being , a story from ?
and this is true of the stories , the the memory that provides and it 's also for the stories , that we invent .
what is a story <unk> are <unk> , great moments and the end .
end of these are very , very important and in this case <unk> the end .
so , that <unk> itself alive to live in continuously .
it 's moments of the <unk> , one after another .
and they ask : what happens to those moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're going to always be lost .
i mean , the most of these moments of life -- and i think that all -- you know , the psychological presence of as about three seconds long . which means , you know , that it 's in a life about 600 million of that there . in a month there 's about 600,000 , most of you leave a trail .
most of you 're completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet you get kind of the sense , that they count really should , that what during these moments of <unk> 's our lives .
it 's the limited resource that we use as we 're on this world .
and how we consume it would seem important to be , but it 's not the story that the <unk> even for us to keep .
so we have the <unk> ourselves and that <unk> myself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the -- with time .
from view of <unk> myself , if you a vacation . and the second one week that is good as the first , is the <unk> vacation twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so does that does n't for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation 's better than the <unk> on , because there 's no new memories , added to .
they have the story does n't changed .
and on this way is time , the critical variable , the a <unk> itself is different from one <unk> itself . time has very profound impact on this story .
so , that <unk> itself is more than to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually any other , the decisions you could use , because if you a patient who have , the , we say two <unk> at two different surgeons had and to decide , which he choose to , it 's the , of how the , of the memory is , the less bad is and this is the surgeon , the selected will be .
that <unk> itself has no voice in that choice .
actually choose , we 're not between those experiences . we choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we 're going to the future thinking , we think of our future n't normally when he experiences .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
and in which can you that 's , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> myself , and they 're able to the <unk> even think more than one , this sort of that <unk> even <unk> through experience , the <unk> self does n't need .
i have the impression that if we 're going on doing this very often the case , that means we do on vacation largely the services matter of <unk> itself .
and that 's a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , very <unk> we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations , the for the dominance of <unk> even gave it .
and when i think about , i think of a vacation , we have a few years ago in the west antarctica 've done , the at the best on was , i ever had , and i think quite often it in the relationship to , how often i started to other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory of these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes long , in the last four years <unk> .
well , when i ever the folder open , have to the 600 images that i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are <unk> half hours .
there seems to one of disagreement , to give them .
well , i like a very , you know , it , how little appetite , i on the <unk> of memories , i have , but myself , if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we give memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we experiences , there ?
so i want , that you about a thought experiment thinking about .
so they their next on , you know , that the end of <unk> all their pictures <unk> , and they get a <unk> drug , so that they 're going to do n't remember to be .
well , they would the same on to vote ?
and if you a different vacation vote would , there 's a conflict between your two kinds of self and they have to think about , as you this conflict to decide , and this is really does not obvious , because if you in the sense of time thinking , you get an answer . and if you in the sense of memories , think you could one another answer to get .
why we the <unk> choose , that we choose 's a problem , this is that turns out with a choice between the two kinds of self .
well , the two kinds of ourselves into two words from happiness .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness , that we can use , one per itself .
you can so i ask : how happy that <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy , are the moments in life of <unk> ourselves ?
and they 're all -- fortunately for those moments , is a fairly complicated process .
which are the emotions , the measured can be ?
and , the way , we 're now in a pretty good idea to get the lucky , the <unk> ourselves over the time .
if you after the luck of <unk> myself wondering , it 's a very different thing .
this is not of them , as happy one person who lives .
it 's about how happy or gets the person is if this person about their lives think .
very different term .
everybody , of these words , not from being the study of happiness up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being , the study of happiness , long screwed that have on that way .
the distinction between the luck of <unk> ourselves and the average happiness of <unk> itself is in the last years , i realized that was , and now an effort you , the two <unk> .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , in the more than a half million people ask about been about what you about her life thinking and about their experiences . and there was another efforts in the direction .
in the last years , we have so i started , about happiness in the two ways of ourselves to learn .
and the <unk> lesson , that we , i believe have learned is , they really differently .
you know , as happy somebody with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot about , as happy , he would be live lives and vice versa .
just about them a sense of the correlation to convey , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is , if you who make that would and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its size of knowledge ?
well , they would be something about its size know , but there are much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell them that somebody to be life than eight on a scale of 10 <unk> , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what the average happiness of <unk> off .
we know that money very important is , goals are very important .
we know , basically means to be pleased to be with people that we like , time to spend with people that we like .
there 's another , pleasure , but this is dominant society .
so if you that happiness , the two kinds of ourselves to maximize that we want you 're going to the end very different things do .
the conclusion from the , what i 'm here we 've said is , we 've been really not going to be as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
well , very quickly , another reason , from the we do n't realize the lucky to think that is , we 're not on the same things look if we the life thinking and if we actually alive .
so if you the simple question , as happy , the people in california are you will not the correct answer to get .
if you this question you think that people in california , happy to be if you say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you about life in california think , think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns to figure out , that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful about ourselves , that decide , as happy people are .
well , but , because the thoughtful about ourselves in charge is , you can the end -- some people could the end to california to move .
and it 's sort of interesting to track , what happens with people , the to california are in the hope , happy to be .
well , you <unk> themselves will not happy .
we know this .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that you happier are , because if you think about you will it reminds be , how awful the weather in ohio was . and they will feel that there you the right decision met .
it 's very hard , clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope , i have you an idea of it gives , how hard it 's .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question of them .
thank you .
now , when we in a few weeks phoning 've mentioned it to me , that it 's a pretty interesting thing was this , from this <unk> survey was .
this is something , what you to participate in this can , because they 're now a few minutes left have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think , the most result , that we in the <unk> survey have found is a number , that we absolutely not to find expecting had .
we found that in terms of the luck of <unk> itself .
if we looked at , emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns to figure out that , under an income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a representative sample , under an income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 years .
dk : 60,000 years ago .
60,000 dollars a year are the people getting unhappy , and they are becoming increasingly less happy , the poorer , they are .
that we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat lines seen .
what happens , is obviously , that money , no <unk> <unk> , but that lack of money , certainly the misery <unk> , and we can of misery very , you measure .
in the sense of the other self , of <unk> myself , you get another story .
ever more money you earned <unk> <unk> is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american <unk> about life , freedom , the quest for happiness .
when people that finding take seriously , would , i mean , it seems to all in the head to ask , everything , what we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so forth .
there 's a chance , that politicians , that the country in general of finding out how the take seriously , would and based on politics , would make it ?
dk : you know , i think , that it recognition , there for the role of <unk> in the policy .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom is happening , they 're and in other countries that happens , they 're .
the people are so , or is , they 're going to happiness , think should , if you in politics , thinking .
it 's a while , you and people will discuss , if you <unk> explore want or whether they <unk> explore want , so we have this debate pretty soon bring .
how to be increase , it 's very differently depending on them , as you think and if you to the <unk> even think , or whether they 're looking at the <unk> even think .
this is politics are i think , in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you . , that <unk> the population .
this is , i think in the next , or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic is , or should at least the most political debate to track to be over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane <unk> . i make games .
i of now for 10 years , online . and my goal for the next decade is , it was as easy to do , the world in the reality to save , as you in <unk> to save .
i have a plan for it . i want more people do , including you all , more time with the play more and <unk> games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` it 's a lot of time for games . ''
maybe something to kind of time , when you think how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve have .
but in fact , my research on the institute for the future that , is just the opposite <unk> .
three billion hours per week are n't even close enough , the most of the world to solve .
indeed , i am convinced that , if we the next century on this planet to survive to , we do this time to dramatically increase .
i 've calculated that took time , 21 billion hours <unk> per week is .
it appears first maybe something <unk> , so again , i do it , so it do you ca : if we issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity out to , i believe we have to try to play online for at least , 21 billion hours per week , the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this is quite right , why i think , that play , so critical for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a the picture of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings to play catch . so he 's of the players , a camera up .
this is one of the classic of the play .
if you ca n't think are , avoid them , maybe some of nuances in this picture .
you 'll probably this sense of urgency , a little freaked , but also <unk> concentration , very deepening in the problems of a really tough problem .
if you also play , you see some <unk> here , after the top <unk> eyes and the mouth that are a sign of the optimism . the eyebrows show a surprise .
this is a player , of the edge of so-called <unk> <unk> is .
oh , you know that . ok well . so we have a player , here .
a <unk> victory is a result , this very positive is , they do n't know , that 's all possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach , they 're shocked to you actually going to that are able to . that 's a <unk> victory .
this player 's just a <unk> victory .
and this is it , what we 're going on millions of their faces of <unk> around the world 's going to , if we of hurdles , of the next century in attacking . the face of those , the as all against the edge of <unk> <unk> stand .
well , unfortunately , we see more of the face in real life , if we are difficult problems with .
i call it as the `` in life , i 'm very bad '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
that 's me , i the `` in life , i 'm very bad '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti and in my former home in berkeley , california where i in my <unk> fact why we in playing better are as in real life .
that 's a problem , that many player .
we think that we have the reality is not so good as in games .
and i 'm not just a successful , though that this is .
we reach in <unk> more . i mean , in the context of the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to working together .
if we 're in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us , in our best version into , anytime and immediately <unk> are , been the problem to solve try , so long as much needed , it after the <unk> a taste .
and in the reality , if we fail , if we on the obstacles and hit , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated correctly . we feel threatened , perhaps most depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in games are you just not .
and this is it , what i was a student at wanted .
why is it in games are impossible , to think , you could n't just anything to reach ?
how these feelings of the play in the reality to ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , that the ideal environment , collaborative solving is .
and i have some things i noticed , the epic <unk> in <unk> so we can do .
so , first , if you in one of online get , especially in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters , that are willing , you a <unk> mission <unk> , which is immediately .
but not just some mission , but a mission , the perfect , to her current level in the game that , right ?
so do you that .
they have never a task that do n't you can solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so they have to the hard . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you is not around and turns <unk> . it 's always very specifically something important to .
and there are of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people , the with them together , to your very epic mission conclude .
that we have in real life , not just like that , that feeling that in a <unk> of employees to stand .
and there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we there are and what we 're going to do .
then get to this whole positive feedback .
they have this , `` level up , '' and `` plus-one strength , '' heard or `` plus-one intelligence . ''
this constant , feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i do this stage to leave , i did n't , plus-one talk , and is plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback , not .
so , the problem <unk> like the world of warcraft , is , it <unk> is , anytime , the edge of <unk> <unk> to stand , that we get our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
until now have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years , so i spent , the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
that 's not necessarily something bad .
it might sound evil .
but to it 's in the context to see , in <unk> million years , began our first <unk> up to go .
the first <unk> primate and so .
ok , so if we talk about it , how much time we now with play on , does that just a sense , when you to the time in terms of magnitude of human development of eyes are holding , what 's extremely is .
but also be appropriate . because it turns to figure out , that we , by we do this whole time to play using , in fact that change , what we as humans have the are .
we are evolving us to collaborative <unk> , very much beings .
this is the truth . what i believe .
at them once this interesting about statistics , the recent one of researchers around the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours , is a very interesting number , from two reasons :
so again , for children in the united states is <unk> hours of the exact <unk> , that you in the school to spend , of the five . grade to the end by the high school -- if you 've never been missing .
so we have here 's a complete <unk> , on the young people just learning , what it , a good players to be , like anything other , what you in the school to learn .
and may have some of you this new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' , read .
so you know of his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it is based on the great research on the <unk> , that , if we have 10,000 hours with the <unk> studies of any subject to the 21st century . age spend , we 're going to coming in it .
we are so good at , what 's also always going to do , like the most people the world .
so , what we have here , is a complete generation of young people , the <unk> are .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are the players are really good ? ''
because if we find that could , we have sort of 'd never been there <unk> human potential to provide .
so many people have we currently in the world , the least an hour a day with <unk> spend .
this is our <unk> . 500 million people , the extraordinarily well , `` something '' are .
and the next decade , we have another one billion players , the -- well in what 's also , are .
if it 's still not 've heard ,
the <unk> developed <unk> , the energy to save and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online can play .
you 're expecting an extra one billion player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started to think , what it is , at us these games coming to do .
here are the four things that i found . as the first thing : <unk> .
ok , imagine if you like the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is the desire , right to do something , a challenge to coming , together with the believe that we have a <unk> hope on success .
i believe , it , that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it is always be worth , it to try , which is the same .
players are not around .
are masters of spiders poet of social nets .
there 's a lot more interesting research , the show , that we are more like , after we with you played have , even if they 're evil defeated .
the reason for this is , it 's a lot of trust that requires , with someone a game to play .
we trust to this , that somebody time with us to spend , the rules <unk> be , we the same goal , and to the <unk> to stay .
so to the <unk> that grow out of ties , trust and each other .
as a result of what we are stronger the social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week he plays , , as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we 're actually be happier and , hard to work , as if we started to relax , or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings , optimal , work , if we make hard , great job doing .
and are always ready , hard to work , if you the right to get .
and ultimately , very epic , meaning .
players love , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> <unk> to be .
here 's a <unk> , the into the right light to go back . we know it determines the wikipedia , the biggest <unk> the world .
the second <unk> the world , almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft , the internet <unk> than about any other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four superpowers , to a single the lead . are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it are people , the believe that , it as a single change the world .
and the only problem is that they believe , you can the virtual worlds change , but not the real .
this is the problem , that i 'm going to solve the attempts .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he looked at , why people that much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witnesses , not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that by an economist . so he 's logical .
and he says ...
not as i -- i <unk> games , i 'm a <unk> .
so he says , that makes you actually make sense , because the player can in <unk> longer achieve more than the real life .
you can in play a stronger the social ties with each other than the real life . they get more feedback and the rewards in games than the real life .
so , he says , it 's currently perfect sense , that are more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i agree , first time to , this is being .
but it 's definitely no <unk> .
we need to start , the real world in a game to transform .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years <unk> .
there 's these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in these fantastic <unk> there 's <unk> .
and that were kind of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the <unk> of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> 're familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about , and why games , invented by .
according <unk> were playing games , more <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> during a famine , invented .
we think there 's such a great famine , that the king of <unk> , to a crazy idea , i decided that .
the people <unk> . the people were .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they do you , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed upon a national strategy . in one day would you eat . the next day you would play .
and they 'd like this very in the <unk> <unk> , there play , so fascinating is , and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity , there is , they forgot to , that 's nothing to eat , there .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> survive it 's 18 years for that famine , by them in one day , eating and the playing .
well as i think , so today we 'll play a .
we put play a , to the suffering from the real world to escape .
we put play a in , especially to avoid , that in the real world n't work , everything that in real life does n't gratifying is , and we bring us what we need from the play .
but it does n't have to the end .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was , 18 years of famine , not better . so i decided to the king , a last <unk> <unk> .
they did this kingdom , in two halves .
they were a <unk> and the winner were to a <unk> adventure , it .
they left <unk> and made , on the search for a new home . they were just so many people back , how it food to survive there and looking to the rest for an area , in the they are able to .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show , that the <unk> , the later that <unk> rich <unk> , the same dna as the old <unk> one .
so i came scientists recently to the notion that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and we geologists , we found evidence from a global cooling , the almost 20 years took , what the famine explain it .
so i could use these crazy story of voices .
you might have in fact , people through play is rescued , by them 18 years for in games <unk> have and then these <unk> , and so much about this one another play learned that it by the whole civilization saved have .
so , that we can also .
we 're playing since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in real the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were 18 years for <unk> , we play for 16 years of warcraft .
i say , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent the half of civilization , on the search for a new world . so i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should it aarhus , the half of us an hour a day with play spend , until we the problems of the real world have solved .
i know , they 'll ask : `` how to solve , we are the real world in games ? '' and exactly this question i mean work in the last few years of the institute for the future dedicated .
we have this banner , in our office in palo alto , it down on out how we the future , do you should be .
we do n't want to try to the future of to say .
what we want , is the future to make .
we want to the best result , imagine . and then people to <unk> , this idea in the reality to .
we put us that epic <unk> , and give people the possibilities , you to achieve .
i 'll show you very short , three games , that i designed to have to try , people that epic <unk> in their own future to give them .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is by 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , in the you a <unk> get to .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it for you realistic it and they her real life in fact , without oil life . so , if you to to play <unk> , they tell us , where you live . and then get them <unk> in real time , the show you , how much oil costs , what it 's not there , as food at risk is how , at risk is , whether school closed are , whether it insurgency is there . and they 've got out how they her real life make , if it 's true would be . and we ask them , blog about , videos or shot photographs work .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 tested . and we have you ever since over the last three years with .
and i can tell you , it was changing the experience .
nobody wants to be life change , because it 's good for the environment is , or because we do it should .
but if you in a <unk> adventures are and i 've got , `` let 's about the oil . ''
this is a fascinating adventure , that you go .
you find out how they survive would . the most of gamers have the the game <unk> habits be .
so we for the next <unk> play a bigger , higher goal into than just <unk> .
we have the game , `` <unk> '' the institute for the future has evolved .
starting point is the calculation of <unk> , that the people just , 23 years on the planet left .
of supercomputers called `` global <unk> <unk> '' , of course .
the call to players , <unk> , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it 's `` <unk> '' there . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and all together , they can the world to save .
but in our own game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 player up the game , eight weeks for .
they found in incredibly creative solutions , that they read that , if you , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game , and we 're looking at 3 . march , out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
if you this game so , get them from the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> '' , in 2010 .
we work with the universities in , sub-saharan africa and they invite a , social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic to . we have `` level up , '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you all invite , this game with young people to share , all over the world , especially in <unk> , the amount of benefits , , and their own social enterprises imagine , the world to save .
i 'm now to end .
i want you some questions .
what , you think happens when the next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games , the show us , we can do , but we have the real world still not be saved .
well , i hope they told me that agree that are human resources are , we 're going to work in real life can use , and that play a big meaning for change that have .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , where social nets to knit , <unk> and this desire to <unk> meaning .
i really hope , we together , actually play games , in on planet one another century to survive .
and i hope you 're dealing with me like to design and play .
if i the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things that safe , that we each <unk> future can make , and that we all kinds of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> games to start !
thanks .
i would you 'd like a little bit about , what i 'm a few months ago , writing one article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write , my <unk> at our , but i was , edit the <unk> already done , and i fell on that i never in my life <unk> have to the word `` a '' really means .
i read them the post .
`` the disabled , '' <unk> , `` <unk> , helpless , useless , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , paralyzed , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , from the traffic moved , <unk> , done , broken <unk> , <unk> , and behold , hurt , useless , and weak .
<unk> , healthy , strong , <unk> . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to read and i had to find laughter , it seemed like this ridiculous , but i was just to `` <unk> '' and i could n't even more <unk> , and i had to stop to read and i first of gather , this <unk> <unk> and the with <unk> emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i got me just thought , that the copy , very old to be .
but actually it was a copy in the early '80s , when i just with the primary school when i started and so i started , my self just outside of my family with build and to form , in terms of other children and to the world to me around .
and thank god , i was no <unk> used .
i would this post take seriously , would i in a world was born , that someone like me as a person can perceive it would , whose lives in <unk> a positive , makes it . today , but i 'm going to the odds and adventure , that i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately the <unk> of 2009 navigated and expect , that i 'm here 's a <unk> contribution like .
there 's the <unk> version of that <unk> .
<unk> it 's not much better .
especially <unk> me the last two words of `` <unk> <unk> '' `` well , '' and `` eat healthy . ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about , what we about the people think , that we do with these words to describe .
it goes around the values , the in these words stuck , and how we these values and build .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people to move around us see .
many <unk> societies , including the the greek and the <unk> , really have believed , the <unk> of a <unk> a great force has , because that what you to <unk> , and also <unk> can .
so what we want to actually <unk> -- a <unk> people or a powerful people ?
just been a human <unk> as a child to call , could be enough , they <unk> and you in <unk> .
it would n't beautiful , you doors to open up ?
a person , the for me doors has opened up , was my pediatrician in the <unk> . <unk> institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , how they 're able , the most americans are not accurate tell you could . so he was always , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful , flying and was for the work with kids as simple .
i found the time , that i in this hospital , i spent have , just great -- to my <unk> .
i had one practice like an often are with these fat , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know , in my <unk> you . and i got that cut more . than anything . i did they hated . i have it bleeding . i did they hated .
and so they , i actually been known as <unk> kid with dr. p. negotiate and so i tried , these exercise to stop , <unk> no success .
and one day he 's me at one of my favorite exercises at -- these exercise was just tiring and mercilessly , and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're like a strong , powerful and young girl , you 're going to one day one of <unk> <unk> .
and if you do it can , going to you a hundred dollars . ''
this was obviously just an easier to trick of dr. p. , so i that will do , that i do n't want to go , with the prospect , that the richest five-year-old girl in the ward in the second one stick to be . but it 's got me in fact that brought , my daily <unk> with new eyes to see . it was it 's a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , very his vision of me as strong and powerful young girl , my self shaped , and i was so imagine being able to me as one of nature of strong , powerful and <unk> person to see .
this is just an example of you , as adults in <unk> the imagination of a child work .
but how the already <unk> examples of the <unk> prove that makes us our language is no room , something to imagine , what we all want to be : every single contrary to enable , , as powerful people to see .
our language <unk> the social changes who , the in many cases , through a technological change that triggered by .
the medical point out at you can kind of course , say , that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titan , artificial <unk> for an aging body , that it will allow people , really all their opportunities to use and to the borders , the them their natural destiny , put it has , out to design , not to speak of social <unk> platforms , people will enable , a own identity , there , , on their own way , and it is , and , with the world to groups with , that they even choose .
maybe we 're so this technological change , more , because we 've ever , that 's always been a different truth , which is , every man of society something very <unk> and very powerful to give you can and that the human ability , to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt to -- that 's an interesting story , because people to me again and that they ask them to tell , i do with against deal , and i 'm going to them to confess , that sentence , has to me , never <unk> and i got me , very uncomfortable with it felt , the questions of people to answer , and i think , gradually i understand what i , why .
this phrase from -- with against lives of the idea , that success or fortunately it depends on , a challenge to coming , without any of the so on the experience a to be . as if my life that they 'll go to be , because i the kinds of one of life with a prosthetic limb of the way could , like , and people to me with my disability to sense .
but the truth is that we change us . of course we are of the challenge of coined , no matter whether you physically , emotionally , or even two is
and what i that is good .
against these are not an obstacle , that we <unk> to , to deal with our lives better clear to come .
against 's easy to our lives .
and i tend to odds of my shadow , to see .
sometimes you realize i , that he 's very your mind is , sometimes it 's not to see , but he 's constantly at me .
and i want to it is not the impact , or . the heavy of <unk> of people <unk> .
there 's in life odds and challenges , and that are just <unk> real and each person is going to another way to . but the question is not , whether we do with the odds be clear , or not , but how we do with you come .
so we 're not just responsible for , the people that we love , in <unk> to maintain , they also to prepare , well it clear to come .
and we be our kids do n't know , if we do you that feeling there , that they 're not to do .
you have to two things you separate , for a the medical fact , an to be , and the other the social think about , if i disabled , or not .
and in order to be honest , the only real and have an disability , with the i 'm just sit down to , is that the world are constantly up , they could me with these definitions describe .
in our desire , the people to protect them that 's the heart of and you the cold , hard truth about their medical prediction <unk> or even a prediction of the quality , imagine that they expected , we need to take care that we 're not the really to put that somebody actually a is .
maybe it 's <unk> concept , the only on attention , what 's in a broken , is , and how we do it to fix , for every single one more disability than the pathology , .

we <unk> a human , the for our society is a value .
so we need to the <unk> beyond watching and us on all of the human possibilities to focus .
the most important , but is , it between the perception of our <unk> and our magnificent ingenuity , a connection there .
we should those challenging times , not <unk> or in denial , we should n't try to avoid , we should they are under the carpet and return , but it 's about the odds opportunity to recognize .
it 's about me , perhaps more about , clear to ask , that we against n't necessarily have to get to , but that we do this open , are , you to hug , and seize to put them to also a <unk> to use and maybe even with it to dance .
and perhaps make it , the odds , as a natural , coherent and useful to see , and feel that 's so by their presence not that had .
in this year , and celebration , we spend 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he 's 150 years ago about evolution has written , darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human nature out .
i would it <unk> , not the most of its way to survive , and also not the <unk> its way , but the , the to change the best to be .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability of the people to survive and <unk> , the battle of the human mind this is , by conflict to into .
so , again , change , and are the greatest skills of the people .
and maybe we do n't , from the timber we <unk> are , if we really not-quite-right to .
perhaps is that the sense of against , a sense of <unk> , a feeling for our own power .
we can go so even something to .
we can odds a new meaning to give the top of heavy time out about .
maybe we can against a change .
odds are for a change , that we still do n't have adapted .
i think , the most of damage , we even <unk> have , is to believe that we normally should be .
time , frankly -- who is normal ?
there 's not normal .
it 's the usual . this typical . but not the normal . and they would those poor , gray person 's really know learn to , if you really there ?
i think , like , not .
it would love , if we this paradigm of normality versus another the opportunity or the strength , and it even still a little bit dangerous to proposing , exchange can . so we can the forces of very many kids putting , and get you invite men , their very special and valued skills in the society itself .
<unk> have we found that we humans from the members of our society , one <unk> have , useful to be , and a contribution to afford .
there 's cues that , the neanderthals , 60,000 years older people and people with severe , physical injuries , by have and this was perhaps , because the life in <unk> of people for the society value was ,
they have these people not as a broken and useless at ; they were as something special , and those treated .
in a few years i went into the city , in the i grew up was , in a <unk> in those `` red zone '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there in a <unk> tomatoes .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> .
and i am , as a guy behind me say , `` well , if that 's not <unk> <unk> is . ''
and i turn me and see these elders man . i had no idea who he 's .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , we know us ? i can i 'm not to you . ''
and he said , `` well , they i , barely able to me remind .
when i do it 's the first time i saw , i want them out of the belly of her mother had taken . ''
oh , so the .
and obviously has it , but then they click .
that was , dr. <unk> , a man , i just from multiple narratives of my mother about this day know , because i course , very typical , to my birthday , two weeks to be late came .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was in the vacation , and so i knew my parents and the man , the me to the world that got to do n't .
and because i without <unk> was born , and my feet , after you <unk> had , and i just a couple of the toes in this and a couple of the toes the other foot and he was the <unk> , of strangers to the bad news <unk> .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents say , that you never walk , would , and never been so <unk> be , would like the other children or that you never been an independent of lead could , and since they 've got me simply lying <unk> . ''
really extraordinary , i found , that he <unk> my entire childhood now has , whatever , if i in a <unk> in the second grade , won had , if i do with the <unk> at the parade to <unk> way was , whatever , if i fellowship , or one of <unk> <unk> <unk> had , and he used these clips to his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , the potential of the human willing .
you can just not enough to emphasize , how critical of a factor for the quality of people to be .
and dr. <unk> she went on , he said , `` i 've learned , that kids , if you do n't always something else said , i get , and if you just a little support to get , if you kids , even <unk> , you can teach kids are very much to achieve . ''
you see dr. <unk> has to be thinking .
he had understood , that the medical diagnosis , and as someone to deal , two different things are .
and i got my thinking of course of the time has changed , if you to me the age of 15 years , they have , if i mean who against the legs of meat and bone <unk> have , then i would have no one second <unk> .
i want to go back then they normally work .
if you to me that today to ask , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i do something with my legs 've experienced and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change is also happen , because i so many people in am , the my door opened have , instead of people to encounter , that i cut , or me an idea on to .
you see it really only one of people , you demos , how they forces <unk> can , and they 're going through .
if you it to enable , his own , inside the forces to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do , and for somebody in a critical moment a door up , then they 're for these people a very good teachers .
they bring them , , the doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means , to produce , that in one is , the potential <unk> .
again , which the potential to do we because now , access ?
in the '60s , was in britain 's a <unk> done . at that were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` <unk> <unk> '' in the united states we call this as `` <unk> . ''
the students to be , grades it .
and the a student will <unk> harder <unk> , getting the better teacher , etc .
they have and then over a <unk> period of students , `` enough , '' the top grade , `` very well , '' there . it was them , they were <unk> , that you very clever would be . and after these three months have you really <unk> written .
and of course <unk> 's a the heart to hear , that way around the <unk> said , i was , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months , too .
but only those that are still in the school were -- apart from the students , the school <unk> had .
so very crucial in this study that was that the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers n't know , that something changed was .
you i was simply said , that 's the student and that are the students with the note enough . and as you have you something teaching and they 're treated .
the only real disability is a broken the spirit of mind , the broken , has no hope . he 's nothing more beautiful . he 's missing , our natural , one curiosity . and our innate capacity for the <unk> .
if we but do , the human spirit and to support to continue to hope , , and other people to , around nice to find , curious , and <unk> to be then put that we forces that really positive , a .
if a spirit of those qualities have , we can be a new reality , and new <unk> do .
i want to a poem end , that by a persian poet named <unk> in 14 . century , written by and of me my friend , jacques <unk> told . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words , you know . '' `` every child knows , not the god the name , not the god the <unk> , but the god , the only four words , you know , and these are repeated , he says , only : come , dance with me . ''
come , dance with me . thanks .
