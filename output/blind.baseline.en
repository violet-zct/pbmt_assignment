yes , good day mean , ladies , gentlemen .
so very much . thanks for the invitation , here today to talk .
and i have to me , now -- imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i am , strange term , <unk> at the city of food .
this is called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> 's first one : computing , and second organization , three , the public policy .
so i 'm going to the <unk> this city in charge .
and yes , that makes you do n't quite popular .
i know .
and it out , and that 's something about my son , particularly like , i 'm also <unk> .
that means i 'm the head of <unk> firemen .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and have i thought , of course , is a subject matter , with the i do you today <unk> want .
which is to the theme of <unk> , because , this is to fire .
we hope to the best and for us on the worst , that 's what jack that once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then start to something not quite so serious to say .
i <unk> you a able to .
so let 's talk , if it , a risk is that we briefly , a disaster , standing , for <unk> <unk> to rush .
many people are the way .
it is , it <unk> .
and somewhere on the edge is a suitcase , lonely , leaving , something <unk> , maybe <unk> with <unk> .
nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase heard any .
suddenly a <unk> .
leave you that <unk> .
the police comes to the fire , <unk> .
people .
officials <unk> .
they go out .
what 's because on ? to ask <unk> .
that we know , not or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave the building .
and cry .
some of maybe even , because it all very quickly go to .
suddenly a <unk> .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic , breaks out .
i am now here on .
the rest <unk> i get your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy , that i <unk> have . <unk> ?
that is , in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's a such a suitcase that remained .
later turned to figure out , that only , in <unk> , nine billion pounds of drugs in there were .
but the people were just so , and that has a friend told me that tells , from the building <unk> .
it was n't told .
and it was exactly this <unk> suddenly , at least in the group on , the my friend in the my friend , found myself .
god is thank you is n't panic have , otherwise would be the long not so benign out how it .
you see , in a <unk> , in a <unk> disaster is communication in a very important .
communication is so important , because people in this situation where people to communicate <unk> .
they want to know , which is because we go .
they used in the good , old was time that for the authorities , pretty simple .
we just have n't told or we 've got lied .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> there .
you have to do it made to say , god , the people come in panic , there 's say , we 'd not the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a time the social media , in a time from twitter , in a time from facebook , in a time of the private and public <unk> , in a time of <unk> and public television , not possible .
just and <unk> so , because it 's one is not a morally is , and secondly , you 're doing anyway , we the past when the agency , over the event to report .
you remember that may still in the <unk> in the hudson river , in which is a year , ago .
the first are about it was at twitter .
of someone , the on the ferry was , and just and <unk> immediately <unk> , here 's an airplane <unk> and we save the people now .
that was no <unk> .
you see , we 're on , these days just and <unk> of the first place the truth to say , and very <unk> to inform .
because , we 're obviously also the past , the supposedly , the truth will know , because we as n't have to course , to be aware that we just <unk> information to pass .
that are public media , or , private media , either not so , in touch or they do it also not .
of so , we will be in the food , and that 's also something that even by the media has gone are , we think about how we in the future with <unk> deal .
and that we 're going to the good old <unk> back out .
however , just as a form of the <unk> .
it means we 're in the next few years about a hundred <unk> in the <unk> build that , some of you know that , <unk> , if you to <unk> coming .
it used it was so .
you know , maybe you know , what 's three in short , once in short , once a long and even just means .
i know it 's not anymore .
we 're going to the right now <unk> with all <unk> , that we look at this is have , so <unk> , of facebook , over onto twitter , the radio <unk> , at night , the television and all over the internet and the local media and so , and immediately , the course , with <unk> , the end of information on going to get .
and we know , we need to go there 's very quickly and <unk> operate and we need to go there 's very quickly and <unk> out , because the <unk> and citizens are otherwise <unk> .
and we ultimately , not that we think what we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so one hand , a question of <unk> about all media , that 's available to stand , and it 's also a question of its credibility .
credibility that is our biggest problem , because the <unk> and people say , either , oh , the overdo it again , right now all not , they say , the <unk> us , it 's all much worse than it in reality is .
we have therefore , too good experience to do with facebook and twitter , so long ago .
and that you may have some of in them the media taken from .
we have a major <unk> in the food <unk> had .
and it 's a called a chemical bomb .
that are bombs , the with a <unk> for are , because the should just let 's not the first <unk> on the <unk> explode , but through the houses in the second world war <unk> and just the bottom of a chemical response , that was going to a little metal , the <unk> <unk> two <unk> of each other so , that . <unk> , and then it came to an explosion .
the problem is just , many of bombs 've never works and it , like , in <unk> under one in the food <unk> .
and we were from an elderly gentleman , the be some extent , he so beautiful in the protocol , i said , easier to , we now , he had seen as you <unk> <unk> like it 's and now <unk> he 's the authorities , about what , that 's a bomb , it is . laughter throughout the background
the way since i have multiple older and gentlemen , reported in the whole <unk> .
we 'll see , what we still got to find .
and bombs to immediately in place , not <unk> be , but <unk> be .
and so we then in <unk> park , just and <unk> one , in every sense of the word , a bomb <unk> let me .
and the first time in the history of the city of the communications , of facebook and twitter going to let me with the consequence , that the <unk> far over <unk> <unk> collectively , followed .
and the media was thrilled . laughter throughout the background .
we had n't even with which the phone , but the have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
it had a great effect for us , because the credibility that by increased about these social media .
just so , they have to me also a sign , there , when i 'll stop to .
i can go from here 's not at the watch check .
this is the credibility and so , because all , these social media for the have , that you very much information pass .
not so very <unk> are , because the members of the and tweeting or the <unk> , you call them , a high <unk> .
secondly , which <unk> .
if you 're not true , writes that , who immediately , so the credibility , of the i just 've talked about , clearly going up , because of the entire community in principle of the report involved .
and it 's a very high <unk> so , so if anything wrong is , it can also very quickly <unk> be .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> , the exciting found , as a bomb , <unk> park up goes .
of and so we from all the things that in the last years happened is , and there are much more <unk> happens when <unk> a still think , as <unk> one knows .
also the city of food can every day of such a disaster home for to .
a bomb , the in <unk> to be in a park , is certainly not one of this .
but they can also , and then <unk> we now , in <unk> be found and then i 'm going to be there with our <unk> and try to the in seven meters deep <unk> .
and if the , you think in munich , you think of other cities , if the then <unk> to be , because it 's called a <unk> has , you take conventional not to defuse that can , then we know , right now , be a variety of houses , after that no more than that look like before .
and that to communicate is important , one hand , because it 's in a in a world <unk> <unk> speed need is , communication to do , to just as well out to prevent , to try to worry about to wear , that the people what are , to try to worry about to wear , that the people have the are , , on these difficult situation work .
and the social media to help us , and , <unk> to be , because ultimately , they all of communication , who are , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> is how we do it in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly , still in the <unk> for large part had .
of why is today <unk> not just a job of the authorities , not just a job of the fire or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and red cross were <unk> , but of communication in the disaster , and <unk> a catastrophe about us all of .
and <unk> has that showed .
there 's about twitter and of facebook , a lot of the help the , if you also partially you still so overwhelmed with was , because suddenly <unk> of any <unk> build wanted and you know what does n't anymore where the <unk> are .
this shows , there 's still a lot to do , for the public realm of communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented solidarity with the <unk> and the <unk> has just shown that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication to do n't even more to think are .
and i hope , that i do you a little bit of belief that i 've , that this medium , that yes , for the beautiful things of life often used to , in <unk> its meaning and purpose of and that we as a city , the for the for the <unk> charge is , this instrument , in the future , still very new , and very different <unk> going to her , to the citizens to use the <unk> and citizens and so the end , i now , and <unk> me very much for your attention , when i do you the entire time , barely seen .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you just have heard .
and i 'm now as well , and , a own <unk> to the reasons .
what it is that there i <unk> make me , that i 'll give you also in a moment ago .
before i think that i do , i have to but a few things <unk> .
the first thing is , i believe that we stories , really want to life .
that we no stories about it could live .
and i think , that 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , there , as of the entertainment business actually produced .
then i think there , that the internet , the infinite possibility is , of fact that well as anybody <unk> really properly <unk> will .
and fourth , i 'm <unk> of belief that people that were created , creative .
and that you happier , are , once they 're creative and be allowed to .
ever more people happy , are , the more than it 's about the world .
it logically .
these better world is now , just a byproduct .
in the first line is me , already said , a storyteller .
and the story , that i tell you want , starting to midnight , in a <unk> , in the just happy <unk> singing .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now get them from the <unk> and the singing , not so much with , because in the moment , in the it at midnight 's become , something happens with her .
it 's something happens in your head , in your body , with their perception .
and it 's not really words that .
they do n't know what 's just happened .
i , words that .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see on the one side <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and it 's a black and white .
i the feeling i am somehow , quite <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other , we have the two and then in <unk> oz -- with very very much color .
and it was in this in the first told that i 'd better <unk> and writing , when that i draw .
so , the first , what <unk> now with their new perceptions that you see , is a stranger man with <unk> <unk> hair , the front of her is , you very seriously at and says , very much congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> about it on , it to a very special kind of people heard .
it was as <unk> born .
players are people that off your <unk> age to your lifetime play have to .
who of you know <unk> ?
very beautiful .
imagine that <unk> it <unk> not their swords , if you each meeting , but <unk> from the pocket .
so these cube , <unk> , <unk> , all sorts of .
what really matters , the players have no insight , on their <unk> .
we know , yes , not , when we die .
i wish is in a long life , but we know that 's just not .
it can also the morning , all already passed .
and so it 's in my players , so .
you know how do n't , to how it because actually can play .
that means , again , every lost minute that the last been .
a player , his entire lifetime <unk> , <unk> the moment of the <unk> as a candle that <unk> will .
now you can of course , another , if it 's because that is dangerous , why are playing the then place ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , without any players to a around , <unk> , all of gray and only when players play , he 's actually alive .
that were able to play born .
so .
this story of <unk> and as you now the world , the players <unk> , your first challenge is , and of course , inevitably , <unk> love , is the story that i tell me .
and it in the form of <unk> .
the first season , has 12 to follow , sorry , i 'm here is a <unk> happens , i just to be late 've seen .
so , 12 , in the first season , of the length of one five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a consequence for the other , beautiful <unk> told , that you know .
that television is doing for his <unk> nothing else .
this is not new .
and if everything would , about , i now one is finished .
and also do n't here .
now is , but just right off .
we go , to <unk> back .
what 's the most set out of the movie or from the series ?
it can only one there , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that would have .
and that 's what is on my players , which is not to .
of which is it 's very many , there .
there 's so many different games .
you just to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so , and so on .
and that <unk> 's also the number of gamers .
and so that 's a lot of stories , the all about to be .
now would be the next question : who is that all share ?
i did , already quite a high view of me .
i give me for <unk> smart , and extremely creative .
but i know , that a hundred brain longer producing as just one , a 's mine is .
so it came right to the idea that you the crowd , in the creative process <unk> .
, what if we <unk> not only <unk> or allow , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very very much , the development of this <unk> with the thing .
imagine , for example , in the result of three up a <unk> on , they 're totally class find , because he did you for example of her grandfather of .
and they 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then you can now just , with the right now , technology is that yes , do n't even more so hard , a <unk> do .
and that they invite the <unk> up , where it right , and that 's really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience <unk> will .
this is , it 's not anywhere among , but it lands right right there , where it up to .
that really nice thing is we the are .
and the internet , yes , really all do .
so , every medium is somehow that allows us .
it means you as viewers , you can write , drawing , turn , as well , they want .
and if we now , again this structure through .
it looks <unk> bit of <unk> net , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up being .
and i 'm really <unk> of that convinced that the internet was born , exactly this kind of stories to tell .
it do is unfortunately , not so many , or at all , none .
so , now go , i but even one step further and in the audience have to the players are .
because in a <unk> .
there , against the characters from the series <unk> but also against people in the real environment , as these <unk> on your cellphone have .
<unk> here , that you are also all very well , is something like mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful areas that 's very rapidly developing .
and on the i do n't go into it , because i would just 20 minutes we need to be .
we ended up again .
everybody 's time has made of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> i could before the jury of , right now , i have to that just see , the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
the have to me the price for the best <unk> given .
and i got to say , the jury was from <unk> of the bank , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so no sensible people to my .
and when i the convince you can , here with my : the internet right to use , narrative structures revolutionize , the way , the world better , then i think , i can actually , convince them .
so .
everybody 's time on this : why that mean , because now this ?
because it alone in the names all areas covered be .
we have of course , first of the <unk> , who is it , i 'm on this , you 're on this , everybody 's time you .
and then that die .
in the series is very very much died .
everybody 's time it means everybody must have a die .
and then , as well , everybody 's time it in the sense of everyone can join , when he wants .
this is , i really important .
i come , from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse in my opinion , as if it 's a <unk> will .
i do n't know if you know .
if you in theater , are and then comes the actor , so in the auditorium and all this : oh god , please , not me .
and this is it 's not .
so it 's volunteer interaction .
and nobody has to .
he can also just the audience .
the reason why i german , speaking is the , that the entire project , in german , will be , first .
that 's also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> while the way , and i was and wondered : do that , but in english , demographic bigger , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i can just say , the german <unk> is the largest the world .
the <unk> is the english , then comes the spanish , and then the german .
it 's now , not so , when i would we 're in some small niche move .
and i believe that actually really , if it also other people that goes like me , that the people will be grateful to be for something , that 's not by any <unk> <unk> was , where the end , then everybody <unk> and every pun <unk> been .
if that everything that goes , i do it would have , is the first result now on the first <unk> <unk> online .
and if you now ask , why i because now i 'm here in a <unk> , where it under the headline <unk> worth <unk> going .
and i also a couple of done .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also very reliant on behalf of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also in and <unk> .
and i can really just say , that this all know , incredibly important is , and incredibly <unk> .
but it uses , it 's nothing , if you a 's not apply them .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just let 's all taken have , what i was so i 've learned .
and it applied .
and so far is 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if now , who thinks , i want to have been my part contribute , i had degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i ' <unk> drawing <unk> cartoon , or what 's also always , that 's also now .
you find ourselves , for the web .
on facebook .
great , as freely in the thing to talk .
yes , <unk> ' i also .
welcome welcome to , you can memories are wiping out ?
question of them .
you can memories are wiping out ?
you can , because at all remember , what in your life ever happen is ?
you 've <unk> forget it ?
who has who can , still at all remind you ?
it 's not the hands up .
so you can memories are wiping out ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , just like that we want 's us today is n't do .
and then i would be the talk , probably fairly quickly .
another good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today , tonight , i chose , because he 's two of my passions , or my two great love right now that .
i , here in the near computer , who and i ' i just with the bits and bytes too , the right now that big through the world .
and <unk> certain time i 'm also now as a coach , and do in private and professional in the way .
on the one side , i so with the with the computer , very much too , on the other , i 'm currently in the way in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how does that that this the human beings ?
how do you because that change ?
the to a comparison out .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion about an artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when we can , when , when we can a computer building , it works like the human brain ?
so , and i think , there are we 've been fairly close up .
so i think , so two , three hundred years , no longer does n't that anymore .
but let me to do , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> bit needs .
so the comparison , between the computer on the one side and our brain on the other .
if we the computer , then based , everything , so your smartphone , you a tablet , you <unk> and these cameras and all of intelligent refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he called cpu , central <unk> <unk> .
these pieces are put together , <unk> transistors .
the word has certainly been all heard , and in <unk> it will always been so as a triangle , the .
that <unk> little device that has three <unk> and forth <unk> electricity , or not .
in our computer in our cpu , we have , i ' extra <unk> ago about five hundred million of these little pieces .
and the turn it 's wild mess .
we save the things , we we figure things , we have degrees ' of albert einstein 's say , listen , 'n computer can all you can be very much , very quickly , but actually he can just zero and one , compare .
more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite <unk> .
we want 's time you compare with our brain .
our brain has as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have them , because i <unk> , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray matter of up here in it .
this beautiful but is , our our neurons have not only three of connections , but the have to <unk> a neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
that are 10 to 14 zeroes <unk> .
so , because you see , the complexity of our brain is a higher than that , what we now , as a computer .
we want to the <unk> time you compare that , maybe the , or other people know of , the first supercomputer that had their own power next stop , ha , the <unk> , and with the <unk> the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and of this is , and this is , the equivalent of two of bananas , so , they need not and her , she 's up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> giant good part up here , <unk> giant good calculator with <unk> , why we use the then do n't understand why that we then things ?
maybe you know the one or another this out the internet , so , the person using only 10 percent of his brain , buy it now this <unk> to the <unk> brain to be .
and <unk> 's wrong . the advertising , a little bit .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is yes , throughout our evolution to this mass <unk> , that was yes <unk> smaller , in the middle of it 's still our <unk> with the inside , anything other has to <unk> formed .
that 's certainly not happen , because we do n't use .
why it seems to then that we the most part of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the term of <unk> ?
the i compared , the more and so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg see , in the sea , is , up so the top , that 's the ocean , down there 's a <unk> .

we <unk> the statement , we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow but we <unk> creative .
and , in time <unk> on this memory back , maybe you know the one or other people with <unk> memory .
people , the , suddenly on a lot more detail , remember that when i do n't seen have , in the situation <unk> , and the tell you then <unk> , i ' said yes , yet , but , where you know that ?
this is , there 's very , there 's a particular , called a <unk> , so someone with <unk> , anyone in the most on a field <unk> , the excellent is , the has a so good <unk> memory , the will was in a plane , rubbish , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is , he then ow ' no , over rome flew , has to rome at , so rome is yes , ow , not necessarily the smallest city , has , then , a giant sign of paper , put it and has begun , rome to draw .
and it 's not a way , so here , so the river , and there is , that , no , every single house , every single door , and every window has he once seen , he 's <unk> , it could be back to paper into .
how come from now that ?
so why can the that , why we ca n't that , well , the conjecture that 's because it may be very close , that the <unk> bit more access to his <unk> percent <unk> .
now we use the yes , but why can i now not in the <unk> last night , remember , in all the details ?
'n <unk> <unk> of me has to interesting about experiences being done .
he has even for example , in the been working and has to a <unk> worked , that had her experience that completely eliminated , that was no more mind , that <unk> <unk> the brain , this is n't happen , that 's gone .
wonderful , with it was the very well , it .
now i went , but that , the people <unk> to do .
there 's it in a very safe session , at the end , or after this event back to , they do n't even more active , that remind you could , i could you then the hallmark of the car see , in front of these people <unk> , that was n't <unk> , that at its feet on .
and in fact , with this hallmark of the on caught by .
the second what i , and i found , was , he has a lady in <unk> had , that has told , that your mom , and alice in wonderland read it 's when they 're small was , so four years .
because i sat them on the lap , your mother and her mother has been reading .
and then he 's she said , in a trance , <unk> but the time ago .
then it has begun to read , it was four times as it 's happened , they could then still do n't read , today can you that .
and then they said , he said , tell me , the <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland found , right on this side of the text up , the lady who read it has .
the brain has so this page as it was <unk> , as a picture .
then we could you read .
so , we 've actually have access to that , but we seem that the normal life would say we <unk> kind <unk> to have to us not to <unk> .
, now to store , we yes , not the event , , but how <unk> have said , he 's a kind of a picture seen a , a a <unk> , we store , rather , our <unk> , so that , what we see that , what we 'd smell , that , what we hear that , what we taste and that , what we feel , hey , if you now <unk> , a yellow <unk> think and how it 's really <unk> <unk> , you have <unk> sense , like the taste , very popular example .
and , it was now <unk> long tonight , put them , but <unk> comfortable to , ha , <unk> slightly up and , you can i do you ask , close it 's just a very short , your eyes .
and you remember a very 're , positive event in the recent past , yes .
take them the first , what comes .
and , if you that now do , will you might notice , it to this memory a visual part .
they get it might be a picture , maybe as a movie ?
some of that 's not only on , because we that normally do , but that they make the first time it .
and if you see that , it is , they 're either in the film is , from their eyes of experience , or how they even see on a canvas .
this one we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , you get to the final thought back to solve , to the eyes , open .
who 's because a visual information to get , let 's hand up ?
yes , there 's go , <unk> ' a few hands up , this is so , 'n third , i would say , yes , that 's about this , what i expected to have , it 's it 's actually something , what we so often do , that 's the first moment n't thing .
well , ' <unk> on .

and now is what 's exciting .
<unk> everything that was , well , the our brain power of the point is no difference between what we actually remember , and the , what we just imagine , what we <unk> .
and that you can try out , if they to home <unk> down and , something in the future , imagine , that still not happening is , they are similar information to do something , if they 're going to something to remember , what the past .
and , , you know , like these stories that you , so here in social situation round , of time .
then , hey , there is that happens , and that , and that was so beautiful , and ever more , these stories <unk> , <unk> get to most of the stories , hey , there were the people still a lot <unk> , there was the evening , much <unk> , there was the sunset , much more romantic , there was the waterfall is still much higher .
if we do it already in <unk> do , so if we really our memories so we can change , why do we do that because it into action , the question i do you ?
<unk> , when i 'm here was , has to me my uncle is a picture that , of his hut in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a very beautiful shack .

and why do we that 's not with our own thoughts , our own memories , hey , that bothers me , because , when i think that still more beautiful do , at what i think it 's degree i think about ?
they 've actually artistic liberty in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , so some people , that they do you see the morning , if you just like this gray eyes have , which is because on ?
yes , i 's slept , i went around the <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea made me not anymore .
i think it 's the other way , he made the idea was n't go .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he was going to germany was , because his mother in <unk> stayed , and he 's what they just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he has to every night with the son , down and has said , has been asking , so , what was because the most beautiful , what today 's happened ?
what was because the most beautiful , tell time , and then he 's going to tell let , has led him <unk> let , has led him exactly what 's , what 's great 's happened .
and , within two weeks went 's the son was doing .
and then it was also okay , that the <unk> way is , the coming , back to visit .
and the is the has that all the youth of done with the , the is one of the <unk> people , that i know .
it so these are not the memories , the us to impact , in the , how we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the idea that we use .
and how much energy we need to stop wasting or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , , that was today now . ow , this is so , <unk> this practice , but i really not , then make it 's and yet , like , you might tom cruise in this <unk> fiction , film he 's this , that these <unk> computer , where he shares his files <unk> <unk> , they do that , but also time , for you picture , that <unk> have of this , well , not quite so great a have , they say , well , <unk> now <unk> happens , but , <unk> , way that .
what ham , we because <unk> ' , ah , beautiful , look , there , <unk> , that 's got me <unk> ' real good , man , that was that was beautiful , well ?
and then take that , but the time with .
take it with in their <unk> and you make this work .
or if you who <unk> 've , <unk> , is it <unk> to her head , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , laughter , they <unk> .
so , and take so again , the image , they <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let the background of horses jump , they laugh , why they laugh , you ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these kinds of funny , are .
and they can be much better with the situation , suddenly we deal .
ca : man memories so delete it ?
no , i think about our brain has been so much greater capacity , that 's got to store it .
it does , but nothing , because we can free to vote , how strong , we focus , and how important to an event , a memory , an idea rate , it comes to us .
my plea to you , at them , play them with the images in your head , they use the power of your <unk> and give you ask him every day <unk> , the their lives , enrich themselves .
yes , good afternoon .
thank you for the invitation .
if i on a party asked me , what i was so in my spare time doing and telling me to put together with friends , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , then i see bright eyes and in the head of my audience the <unk> of the dancing crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> up .
if i then <unk> , that it , the festival , to a festival , classical music is , say , of those dancing crowds of the old people , the in now , long <unk> in <unk> of sit and very focused on the art , listen .
frank <unk> once said , about music to talk about this is so how about architecture to dance .
and so similar to behave . it also with the what we do .
so you yet one of getting what i 'm going to speak , i put them a short film with .
film .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
this brings it from my view of the best on the point .
since <unk> growing the <unk> from the <unk> got out , something completely different to do .
we makers , are today , so forth between <unk> and the middle , the end of two decades old , and have very early in our youth who experienced , which we force and delight us understand classical music <unk> .
we have , but also know , that the <unk> of <unk> and of <unk> us , some time , well , a little <unk> can .
and we are the solid belief that called the crisis of the classical music not at the content , so on the music ourselves but at their <unk> it .
so let 's imagine the question , how we can a <unk> create , that the music the near , the friends and this power back there , the way that we as much of you like .
how a <unk> organize that beyond the <unk> the <unk> work ?
we imagine the parameter that you from the classic concert will know , space , time , light , the context , basically in the question .
take for example , the relationship between the audience , and musicians .
normally , there 's between the stage and the audience a gap .
we 're trying to the pick .
now you a picture of our <unk> .
the musician , sitting in the audience , drink beer , having to the breaks down with the audience , standing on , play a , two pieces , so , again in the audience .
it 's the course of the evening , a little <unk> .
everybody , the got has <unk> , coming on the stage and goes back .
or that are sitting in the concert .
in the classic concert , it is that you on more or less comfortable , permanent chairs , like you here , and after the front of look , and listening .
but there 's music , because you can actually do n't sit still .
and we 've thought that made , how do you that are .
if you different to sit and , to a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , then hear them automatically be different .
still going to come to in this concert does n't a stage , they did , but four stages the audience around .
the audience could yes <unk> .
so i sat in the night every once in the front row .
important for us is that we 're not only just any <unk> do , but that we of the music from thinking .
that we so i ask , which spaces and the atmospheres around , but also in the head of the people need the music is that it 's so that can see how they are supposed to ?
and so that come then at concerts by night to <unk> at 30 in <unk> , the s 's actually just by <unk> lit that are , in clubs , on <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around and the illumination can make music is alive to make and now , but the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy that we 've been a few years , <unk> to work together , with us the dances , or movement to music <unk> develop that actually do n't need to dance been written is .
and so that then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> from steve get rich .
and in this year we have to a , yes , if you that wants , <unk> has .
we have the first time a concert together with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and you <unk> to a <unk> together .
that has , especially , that works , because we have a <unk> had , the us in this piece which has .
we have about a <unk> much money from people out , germany , back , so that we do it into could .
there 's this festival is something , what from a community turned out of .
we 're totally happy in the near of <unk> in the small <unk> a home , they found .
the city is exactly that big that we 're great spaces and exciting place for concerts find , but also that small that we notice .
if the beginning of the year in the spring , two weeks forty <unk> out , europe in the city are , then drops out on , that the town , more people with <unk> around , usually .
the festival is <unk> organized .
we makers , are a very colorful mixture of students and students , medical professionals , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really totally totally mixed up .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> that the <unk> or a coordination , and funding in the eye , keep , <unk> , seven to 10 makers in a <unk> , for for a year compulsory tasks are .
it 's also <unk> , but they care , for a year 's that for example , that <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in a permanent hands are and to festival , organized to .
we do that all in our time and live in , germany .
that means , the part of work is <unk> and on a <unk> .
just three times the year we make us about the year distributed to an extended weekend , <unk> , to talk about the one or other problems that popped up are , and caring for also the interpersonal together , that just hugely important is if you something like in motion to keep .
to festival , even come then 20 to 30 volunteers first to the for a few days or a few weeks of their hands to bring and touch , where the help it 's going to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course , in these 14 days from the musician to .
now you could mean , so we have you do anything that you for this is a festival needs .
but our <unk> goes on .
we have , which is in <unk> in the city a community to move around us this sort , that 's backed up in the what we want to do .
that goes from the classic <unk> go , this is , but also about very practical things like for the <unk> , because we have a baker , the us to bread <unk> or a <unk> , the us , fresh food available to imagine .
that <unk> is in a <unk> in the city and over the year and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole lot of private found that 's your living off to have to the musician , there , where we can .
and on this kind and it 's the festival , to something own in this city has become and of the people in this city .
they identify , in a very special kind and the way with this festival .
since the beginning of the year , we were thank <unk> support of the citizens in place a <unk> into live out , the right now the entire endeavor in a <unk> and reliable <unk> turns out .
we makers in the stage , believe that classical music <unk> , provided it comes in the right hands .
so we 're incredibly happy about that in , europe , young musicians , music in your hand , and home in , in the cities <unk> hold .
if they 're now still not that really can imagine , like , it feels , classical music that way to experience , then they come , just over .
the next year we 're back in <unk> and we were going to us forward , if you then , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you think maybe you know , acquire skills .
you heard about this for learning or the effect of learning , but i mean , for learning is still much more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
we know that 's experience , <unk> , a formula for the <unk> .
what i made of art and culture learned to have , well , because you can i was a lot of course , to say , because now . ar <unk> <unk> i yes , in this field .
and so i thought that it might be really would , this is something <unk> called a different <unk> still going to give , what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , power , but much work .
they have now , laughter .
you get more and the laughter , though most of the saying that we know .
why is that ?
i think , that has to do with , that in the word or beautiful thing <unk> , what we 're not that really capture that .
art , that 's say , sometimes , that 's what .
to work we 're saying that often , that 's what .
sometimes , too .
the people , the like to work , that 's going to me .
but at work we think more in the <unk> and at the art more in the realm beyond the everyday , where we us in moving , our experience collect , our own ideas evolve .
and , so i mean <unk> that i you now <unk> want , in about three hours in five actually shared , all the <unk> have , with a i start , so it for them just is .
it starts with the <unk> , for childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , goes and further , the word <unk> i 'm later , why i that for my <unk> taken .
the interaction , for the first part of my professional life and finally , five , positive identification .
<unk> one of you will this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian stream know .
<unk> , two , and <unk> .
you learn it in the first two , three years , you 've done reasonably puts , and i reasonably practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have these little pieces of playing , on the piano , not far from here , the <unk> , to home .
these pieces of living by a <unk> .
there 's a melody played and the different voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm is right , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial in art that succeeds , and if it just two voices are , <unk> together , together to think if that the present , the future , the past , sometimes , in works , images , in <unk> , in <unk> , things that <unk> are , on the moment to bring together , that 's doing art from .
and i and learned , two different melodies , sometimes , three , in the <unk> <unk> , at to play , any kind of but to hear that a <unk> , the other not .
that was , what i learned to have , under one .
a another experience , i 've never forget , and i the worry had to me today may also like to be .
i have the piano <unk> , it was still more people in the room , here today , and in the <unk> i came out .
i did it in mind .
i brought her played .
so again from the front of starting and at the same point i knew , not on .
the audience has more <unk> almost as i , because i went in all quiet on my place , brought my notes , put them up and started the third time of forward .
and they do n't like me <unk> 've got behind .
but that was a very heavy experience .
maybe it was also one of these experiences , where i then you know , well , with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> had , i should perhaps not my <unk> go , because to talk , easier to cheat .
yes , the next the next chapter in my <unk> i said yes <unk> with the inspiration and also because i want to you tell stories .
when i then that <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and told him , rather , sir <unk> , i want to a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
because you very many <unk> to have and a lot of experience with women raised .
now imagine if they time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , so a sentence .
the i course not forget .
and from there , i course , more practiced .

i practiced , and i remember , a situation that i like never more experienced .
it was that <unk> of <unk> of chopin , and now i 'll to the part of work , i have a to just not by , and it was with the most beautiful in place , very broad you had the poor do , and then went to this together again , and back apart .
i can it now , not to play , is not a piano , here , and i could it also not anymore .
i have this point two decades , 30 times on playing and suddenly got them properly .
and then i do you keep playing and <unk> , i got me in one of ecstasy played , and i know , only still , that i suddenly on the ground quit and laughing .
i was except me .
i did n't had to do n't have taken , and the music has this with me so i 've done .
an experience , where i learned to have , emotions , really allow us .
and sometimes it 's also really , this work that you in this <unk> <unk> , in this condition , i call it , the <unk> .
where all of yourself going .
we had this situation in fact , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like a lot of myself , when we the <unk> did , the only two months taken , where you usually a half years to need to .
well , this was my experiences with the piano , with the artistic , with the artistic work .
and now i 'm going to my student , <unk> .
i was first , even when musicians and the way , but i just as <unk> .
we have <unk> played , <unk> , <unk> .

in the choir singing , all breathe , a <unk> singing , great experiences , the me very , on <unk> .
and a point , where i as <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> went am , in the <unk> and the overhead , and i do that 's why do with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , because there for me this <unk> came , that this idea came to figure out of this combination of art , culture , i was , <unk> , just in the <unk> have , politics and law a job to do .
which is the art , culture to enable , to my <unk> to do .
so here to work for the art , but it 's not as artists , but , otherwise would you , not saying <unk> , but rather than <unk> <unk> and further to do something .
i was there in theater and i 've got me <unk> , there 's been in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , and i <unk> , and from there , i 've always more with this question about , what you can do , the art to enable , the framework for art to improve , to a management , a management of building ?
and this was the reason , why i then also <unk> 'm in my professional , in towards this <unk> , and with <unk> years , i mean , then <unk> .
but it was a other <unk> , and this phase i said yes <unk> with interactions .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my c.v , because i in <unk> born was , and it says , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about <unk> i , i have to this kind of time <unk> .
but i mean , a <unk> root , because my grandparents , maternal were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the <unk> experienced .
that was i 'd rather something that i 'm not so the have , and suddenly i was this in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture that lived in terms of people in this in this <unk> device the <unk> .
once the <unk> on us was , were all in a very different situation , in very different states .
and i then with <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , of my friend and colleague who was , because we have then , for the <unk> night , music is done , he had guitar , i piano , others have a bass , played , for example , i was at her <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but of course , text , the <unk> <unk> , months practiced .
and this <unk> , that was really from the people out .
it was my destiny to the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't even with that the wall fell .
i woke up the next day , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is like , yeah .
i 've got me , quickly that are prepared , in any questions for <unk> .
and ab : there was i <unk> for the cities in the east germany .
and i again , experienced , interaction as social interactions take place between two young german cultures .
actually talk to the same language , the music is there , wonderful and was wonderful , played , but a lot of it was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the <unk> got it 's not from the people got myself , but it was a lot of the top , and that i as a gain 's , here to experience , like the german identity , that i 'll later , let 's still time , to slow , very broken , and the german <unk> then these two states <unk> .
since is germany , yes <unk> .
now is also on the <unk> much more <unk> places .
interaction , i then , but in front of things here we learned and experienced , in the city of food .
we have of the first place that i had the way , a <unk> , imagine if you time ago , when i 'm here 's started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and spare time .
i have the still .
his hands up for <unk> , you did n't write <unk> for culture , <unk> .
i was , which is the first director of <unk> .
so i play is not so much so , anyway , it was wonderful to these <unk> had , but they have disappeared , soon , because i then for education in charge , and to make alliances , education do and make things .
we have very much for the urban done , we have the if you only time of the analog in between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see what we 's designed to have to the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between the works and architecture of it , the <unk> to <unk> of the blue are rocks .
many of interactions , we were and i could make and i 've experienced , and them what that means , if different people from different areas , a target to track .
you can actually , i always more <unk> of the art , and more to the culture , the us makes us , that <unk> between humans , between cultures , between community , better said , in the view , and i come but later on the art back .
interaction was also then between the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea was , the would january <unk> , that <unk> be able to the <unk> europe -- .
but this last chapter , this one fifth chapter one has yet the headline identification .
this word has yes , two different meanings , for a , i <unk> me with something , <unk> me so to something , and i can it , as verb , use and say , i <unk> something , that means , i know something .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i <unk> you or the or this community .
and i <unk> me with something , when i 'm going to <unk> and say , this is to me , with the i want to identify .
and that 's a very big action been .
five point three million people trying , to move , <unk> cities , is to identify in a double the sense , to <unk> and to see , that you a community is in europe .
as big , we have , it <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people that in a big <unk> life and yet at least a common language talk , even if <unk> nations are here and this was our <unk> , the identification to start with the people and of them , too much take out .
at the signs , at the <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
an experience of the <unk> i have not so many people around .
so ham 's <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , worked , young girl from <unk> , of the <unk> , and boy , students from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , you have the letters of people , young men , from <unk> to a play data , the home , say goodbye , love , death , the last of letters is written .
and it was already a special effect , that young girl letters from young <unk> up and boy , the russians and then the letters from young men from germany in a <unk> german .
and sat down , of these young men to the piano , and he played this <unk> , i was so loved .
and , oh , here he from a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him , home , as a young german , he was playing , and i ca n't even more a <unk> play , because my my two fingers on <unk> are .
and he <unk> his hands on with a <unk> , sat down , again , the piano in that play on <unk> carl , and trying to the <unk> to play .
and it managed to do n't .
it was for me as a <unk> scene , that i want to the front of off am , i said , what we 've actually learned ?
we 've learned , in the <unk> that many people together to move to , but of all things we 've learned that we <unk> years in <unk> in peace of life and the culture of us that connects us that we do n't know , the minds go , because we different languages to talk to us to identify , to us <unk> feel .
and this was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it goes to learn not just about , something to know .
it 's about the learning and that , something to learn and <unk> to win .
and if we 're much up and invention , let , <unk> , if we tolerate that we inspire , let of art and culture , our own right position to relate , in dialogue with the artwork , if we interact and finally , in our own identity and work , by us with art and culture a so , then we all won
and i hope is , they still many <unk> and <unk> have , from where they those profit to move .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we wait on the first picture of .
so i to <unk> to support my memory , this is a few slides <unk> .
it is , but no scientific slides , but it goes in my <unk> here 's about , a way to find and me with a topic , through , where i think , that 's going to the next few years , significantly , are .

and then i was still have heard , that you the talk , in english think we should , if somehow it possible , but , if you to look , then you see , they would n't understand , what i in english , i wanted , i did n't know , right , i do it to say , and so i 've got the talk , then , but in german , left .
how we die .
i have to them because the first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , in which i the <unk> <unk> , and was <unk> .
it was about <unk> years old and has always like in the may , dance , because they also , her husband and remembered that the first man , in war like this was then .
and this is it every year for the first may , for dance , went and has a dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> to a lot had , and is then <unk> and has , here on the right-hand side you see this , the leg , broke , the <unk> .
a few years earlier was they also , even <unk> and i had to the same way , with the same reason , it 's the left leg broken .
and then i was also been there , as a doctor and i 've experienced , as you for weeks on the icu was , as you to antibiotics treated by , resurrects was , and i have the discussion around , as i was , is because that all of sense ?
it 's actually make sense , in a so old people like this intense 's going to use to get ?
so about , to <unk> , on the intensive care for weeks , it 's a people at all <unk> ?
and it 's and cured been .
five years later i 'll the clinic , i look at the name <unk> , and the can i 'm good at , because he just so rare is also for the time , then , and has the dance in the may be back the other one leg broken .
so it turns out the question , what <unk> i actually , when i talk about this , as a person for decide to , what he in his directives write , or what he also , <unk> which ?
and that 's a bit of the theme of <unk> .
you see here and the <unk> of called , how we will die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going to be a report , the <unk>
and then it was so that the globalization is very strong that went to so you ask , how it because they go , connected to work ?
you then , and that you can in this book is also read , just said , it 's a quality to come , so the parts , together .
it 's a networking of working successes , it 's also the work , a lot more you 're going for instance , to china , that was then a big issue .
and this is then also like coming , that basically the work of individuals , so something assemble , something making , and lower <unk> was him , and more control was also of the quality , that he <unk> , of the accuracy .
and that , after my assessment , the people 's always sort of confidence from their work to could and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it that was , as height of <unk> to reach , and no more about , through his work . also to define .
and if we now into the <unk> and medical domain of , then there , that one development .
if you in television even hear about the doctors , nurses and also <unk> the most <unk> , then you are the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there must have documented , what you has done , so it <unk> is , so it 's actually paid to , and if not to document is , says the health service 's also , that care or the medical treatment for we do n't .
and through the documentary , but the work on the <unk> and more <unk> and more and is this idea , to his work has and to use of personal belief <unk> , in the background , so a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me is now , in holland gone , because he this is no more to , the had a <unk> practice , has the abandoned and is , in holland gone , the doctor for <unk> to be .
the <unk> are in such developments , a piece of forward and he , martin , had just experienced , and more old people by between the <unk> , the hospital , and back , because the <unk> n't know , what they should , if the people got worse , i went .
then get the the hospital , to have restored to go back into the senior home , or <unk> , and be there on those .
and this family had , just thought , if that 's structured ways in holland , there , then i want to 's like to train , let that 's something to promote that you out of this vicious cycle of the <unk> and the also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there , well , in holland , which had he , well , after he the language with much trouble with had learned that there , the same thing happens , what in this <unk> happened was .
it will also the dying , increasingly a quality introduced .
it 's no longer the credibility , the count , but you put even in a really notice , i want for example n't problems are , or not the hospital , if i in nursing home am .
and then the <unk> .
in holland , it 's so , the third day you find a conversation with the <unk> instead , and the need to then , an , i want to the hospital or i do n't want more the hospital , when i 'm doing something happened .
that with the , i want it resurrects , or i do n't want resurrects be .
this data go then at a central and there is that doctor for <unk> , has always the <unk> ago , and you could use then the decision on that basis .
if we now to <unk> back , the yes , like the may , dance has and once <unk> was , and we imagine , the have some of directives wrote , i do n't want it resurrects be , then we have you the second and dance in may , in the may , where they then again <unk> is , admittedly , no more to experience .
and that for my friend now , the there in holland sitting , also very much <unk> , he wants to manage to .
in the last is that <unk> today about <unk> to seventy percent of people do n't even more to home to die , but in hospitals , <unk> , and that these <unk> just as well , so you can do that are able to do n't the ideals of habitat are for the old people , but it is often , we do we <unk> <unk> , the <unk> are often <unk> and the <unk> , and for this <unk> find there , my sense , just constrained , instead .

it 's obviously <unk> reasons , that 's very clear , this whole quality , that control is why we introduced , because the last the money for it 's not enough , that all people , optimal , and in <unk> of those are and that the people , the care deliver or the medical excellence , so they 're paid , that they say , there , come i do well , right , because i can for example , as a nurse a family of feed , or two children .
this is simply not the fact , but you need two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and mostly it then , just .
this introduction of the quality as a result of the growing the market , you bring governance to , it . so , on the individual affected .
and now i 'm going to , how to the might get it , so what do we now in the past , because i mean , first of questions asked , and show , so very simply is the situation for those individuals .
and i just time that <unk> <unk> and the article in one of me , there <unk> , because i think , a society is always like this structure , and legal structure , which we all this <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> papers which is just , the dignity of people 's <unk> .
and the second set up there is , you to protect is to get a task of all <unk> .
and what i sometimes it 's missing , is a third set in there , because every one , for the assignment have to to be able to protect and to defend themselves .
because it a way is , to myself to free from this case , i give it in other way , and the supposed to me a kind so , and feed and practice , i was looking at least not thinking about doing , i because even die , let me .
because the past , it is yes , so , we this subject does n't like to imagine , we are some of the point , coming .
hopefully you first time , with hundreds or <unk> .
that 's kind of my career as well , to say , that wish i each and i want , care , but eventually you going to the subject to have to , and if it may be so far is , or , just , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it already late in life to be late in life , to say , i want to talk about this question now , thinking .
if you now think about , what does mean , would come out , then you going on the dots are , where then the last out , which is because actually the five most important things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , what 's pretty en <unk> is .
it is the self-esteem of course , it is then the friends , that i , which i 'll discuss and they can , that i know , and the me through that live with , it is the <unk> .
it 's sure that trust between humans , which i may also to do have , in <unk> or in <unk> area or a pastor or a <unk> or just other people , which i do in the relationship <unk> .
and it is there 's a lot of factors of course , that there <unk> , i 'm the right now , not all through .
but if you . these three key points , let 's look , then you have been a lot of tasks , you , in life there may <unk> to , to the past its own going to protect .
and then coming then still a another factor that that we 're a certain dictatorship , the <unk> experience , i did this time , so as a text , or as a as an example for it took .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , what 's <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would be of us to myself out there .
so it 's not the question , what are because others to me to do , who 's going to me because the power , for instance , or , for me to use , who goes on me to ?
but it 's exactly the other , to ask , where i can be on the people <unk> , where can i do and by my inner to gain , that i do with these questions to deal , and me that position and make it .
and if you then he says , how we work , so that inside the quality , the us from outside , put it was , it 's a way to say , i how to me about my my inner would , this mechanism to escape .
because no man can see me <unk> , i myself , because you see , and position .
and i must be there 's also do n't fit into in general <unk> or the opinions , the say , you have now a directives fill and because you 've been so old are , kind of you , if you resurrects going to , if you on an icu want .
these questions , that i can be in the last only after a long <unk> probably <unk> do .
this would of people 's a the posture , the in me is , and the not from the outside that can be , the state , not protecting it , as a law , not , and that i also other people <unk> can and i tend to <unk> be , when i just there for themselves before , which <unk> have have , so that 's also know , what i for a person 's me .
and those conversations to lead , it 's spaces , and i think , and so i have this talk that 's called , and here , for , are these spaces like that <unk> in the food , that i put them here two things tried , on a picture times <unk> , spaces , where we about these topics are thinking to , where a more room is , so it does n't hurt is that 's also may not in theory is , but that 's a conversation , there is .

thank you to welcome very much .
the beautiful good evening .
i 'm two things with .
if you the first part to flat , is , you think , a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
we start with the infinite possibility of .
this is stupid , not , can take you .
what you mean ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is forever enough ?
yes !
this is not good if this one of it 's , of what 's .
so , in fact , but i 'll it off , for the , the know it .
it 's what we do n't .
we engage us with just a single .
and i frontier that would like a little bit . '' for a finite planet .
<unk> , <unk> we know , an infinite and we have a to know .
and it goes to the <unk> the magnitude of vast amounts .
if we in a finite way are , and just two <unk> , in the one for example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , suppose , already now , we look in the box goes in , the number is small , there are three chairs and there are three people .
we can we will , whether in lots of the same number of elements in it 's ?
we count , how would we do ?
that means we would just the people <unk> , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , at three chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and wonderful .
that you mean , yeah ?
very beautiful .
it works in the finite wonderful , it works , in large numbers , though it <unk> .
but it does .
how do you , counting ?
how do you , will , so many people like your chairs , there are ?
i realized , chairs and people were taken and not what else .
<unk> let me !
it 's called mate .
you very well , that this is clear , not , now we 're in life the way , and i have to understand that all .
not that 's very beautiful .
so , it 's called , professional a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , of them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , way , the next <unk> , everything is use , different people get different chairs , not a chair , but empty and the vast amounts of the same size , okay ?
now we go into the infinity .
how we can two an infinite amount to compare ?
we would say , the one is that big or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could we it do ?
we were going back to .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite long of start to count , yes , i would , just say , they are not to another .
<unk> , forever , is clear , <unk> ?
so , how about it ?
madame ?
no way , madame !
they had that 's just really started .
they mate .
so , so let 's the time .
we estimate , we estimate is the infinite always bad , yeah ?
you see , you see , no end , yeah ?
the point is what , you make it very simple .
if i example , the <unk> take , natural numbers , <unk> , we computer scientist who need the zero , the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we have , we say , a copy of this <unk> and take out of this exact replica of infinite you <unk> pay off .
left to the just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all straight numbers are <unk> on the infinity in long band of the natural numbers , but on a band missing the <unk> , on the others are the straight and the <unk> on , okay ?
we call the a lot , g , the straight to pay , we call the other one of n , the natural numbers .
what you think ?
is g more powerful , it 's bigger than through n , same size or smaller ?
in a big ?
this is , but very <unk> , in the a missing , the <unk> .
who have a different estimate . '' ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , that has yes , really did n't plan , yeah ?
that yes , not be , yeah ?
you ca : yes , not , where what 's missing , bigger , this is n't , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
you 'd assume , not ?
this is the conventional , what you suspected , of course , is wrong .
and now , and now i 'm , why the amount of the same .
how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line of , we take the zero from the natural lot , mate , out .
the next one of zero , plus two is two , after the zero from the one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , six , the three , eight , the four , yeah ?
you can it also turn , it 's doubling , this is clear , <unk> ?
and completely clear that is , by the <unk> make it that i do it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there are just straight on the band is a long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural on the line , <unk> , the <unk> are out and the band is still a long .
it 's just in the infinite .
so if you some explain , what we have today i learned to have the infinity learned , yes , what 's because it forever , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of has a property , that 's in a finite 's not and this is , is absolute <unk> , a real subset of the right that big .
that do it in the finite not , if you from three three people are two people <unk> , is only one , and before they were , three .
yes , so we 've infinity .
is not <unk> ?
okay .
then we do we still a second part , the odds .
the professionals , strongly genetic probability .
i here , which brought .
at this experiment i 'm sure , it 's at least a third know , and <unk> it does anybody with , the that on it has , yeah ?
so , we call the doors to a , b , c .
i 've got behind anything on , i hope you 's not heard .
and they should now the first , guess .
where , you mean , i have something hidden , behind a is , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate , c .
who has one another idea ?
a to ?
who still has an idea ?
'm going to <unk> , b 's missing , not , you hear the yes , never , <unk> ?
this is right .
it 's a matter , so they have to do n't mean , the three of letters to fall , and i 'm looking for me a .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , right , because , the the opportunity , she has lucky , is yes has only in a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i doing this , i 'm just one on .
well , i know , where it 's up .
<unk> , that has to here somebody , <unk> .
so , i know , where it 's up , and that i guess , and the value , or like , and you do it 's called , goes in a second round .
so i 'm now really the game <unk> i now , which now , that <unk> .
so it 's so , we go into a second round .
now , suppose , i <unk> me on that a , <unk> ?
so , now i have to a door to show , behind the it 's and that they do n't have said .
because , if you now , b to say , and i say , and i know , it is yes , not of b .
then there , not a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , luck had .
but i have to yes , that 's <unk> , in the second round to go .
so i can just an open , behind the it 's not just not is , but what they also do n't have said .
now is the question , and this is that strongly genetic likely , under the 'm here has remained , under the condition that b open is , and it does n't there is , you now your last chance , news to guess .
you can now in a to stay , then i do necessarily a , on .
i 'm now this on , what they have to .
or they say , i 'm doing , c , on .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become evolvable ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's behind c .
or , but , god 's thanks to b , open been is , i wanted to always looking at a to stay , this is it .
or you were going to say , is yet <unk> , we have , <unk> , way that , we 've only still two doors , now it 's no matter , to change , or to stay .
what you mean ?
it 's no matter .
<unk> .
why is n't matter ?
very beautiful .
why it 's why is <unk> ?
yes , right , that 's wrong .
it does mean , almost , as if we do it yesterday <unk> have , <unk> ?
but that are you , <unk> , are a new no , fun .
so , here , the thing is very <unk> , yeah .
understand that all sorts between , i do n't , six and , i ca n't <unk> years , you can i 'll no more coming up , <unk> ?
so , '' really want everyone .
behind this door is it to a third .
and it 's always just to a third of a door .
you can guess , what they want , they have with two thirds of them in the dirt .
this is , they would be able to two doors guess , not , that you can yes , at <unk> do , you can yes , to two dozen and put it is yes , <unk> , if you the zero , <unk> , this is it , everything in life .
but here we 've just a door .
so now this is this way , two thirds it 's not what you guess .
so it 's the two thirds of here , but it can , but just behind a door of !
behind the is a 's not !
so , which is then more likely ?
way , i 's really been hiding .
so , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or to change ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , of course .
so , that was now not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they have any luck had .
why ?
very simple , two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope , it was for each of what this .
thank you .
mr. <unk> , you to me , jamie oliver <unk> , the here just by bad diet and bad food and overweight people out has , this depressed , yes , completely .
but i <unk> , my best that after all the way is , that some .
i come , because of <unk> farm , and you know , until i was 12 was actually not a mcdonald 's .
that time , who , right .
, yes .
thank you very much for the invitation today .
i 'm here in the close up .
and i do n't know , like sir <unk> , so on it came to me to ask , if i look at ted , the sea , coming up to and over a particular topic to talk .
i told me <unk> <unk> : the issue of trust .
i realized , motivation is also not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> , that has said , maybe the power of a or another afterwards , sports .
about i also full of this , have .
so today at night in the rain , jogging to be now <unk> much demands , but i have to make tomorrow , training , because i 'm in three weeks , <unk> june , <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to go to , i 'm half a bike , that <unk> miles .
would give me this morning , the rain this training do n't <unk> .
so who 's a ride want to <unk> , go tomorrow , early on , in <unk> , i <unk> , they all welcome to a .
i degrees , i said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> over the issue of trust .
and i ' i started , do , with the subject <unk> .
do n't worry , this beautiful , little <unk> , the blind faith comes up afterwards <unk> .
i did before me just thought about it did , when i <unk> 'm going to describe to the where i <unk> ?
so , i come from 'm half the village with six houses , you <unk> , some <unk> and in my parents on the farm there 's an apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what do you from <unk> , beer .
trust , in sports , obviously not in the <unk> but at me , <unk> and beer .
why use , i the story , where i 'm from ?
for me is one of the very important stories , that i really so right from the country , the village , come , and there was raised me with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> is .
and with the second half brother , the same blind is how i .
mean , the looks like bright and dark , the can see how i just also see , where <unk> window in space , whether it 's light at is , or out .
what today , which is for the <unk> .
the , we both can you see , if of us anything .
'n <unk> , but i say , and i ca n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> <unk> .
of the subject of the old men , <unk> .
and to go <unk> .
and what to me , but always , there was , is the course , the fact , wrote to trust and get just this great confidence , that <unk> , that we all need , <unk> as something <unk> situation , say , i time .
and that was for my parents definitely , that you how many of them , in my brother and i still do n't blind people knew .
we were so the first , then , which suddenly appeared in their lives <unk> are .
and then they had to from the situation of what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a giant fortunate that my parents than farmers are not all the day long time had to us to stand and that the hand to or to say , there 's <unk> wall , there <unk> you , along and you can then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
a , that would be awkward been -- we 've got home so <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents of the beginning to us to them , and then to go , where we also our sighted brother is .
so , the house by <unk> , the <unk> down and <unk> , and risk .
there 's the blind brother and then with 'm <unk> <unk> courtyard , pushed <unk> used in .
the <unk> the <unk> i until today .
this is that with the big brothers -- that are not only good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brothers and and my brothers and i we ham in 'm half a courtyard of that all the outside did , ma , you could do , especially for bicycle on .
and that 's the <unk> brother and excitement started with three years , and then we were obviously also -- michael and i .
and then started , with <unk> to drive , in many little kids , today with the wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that started with <unk> , eventually , no .
and then is the big question : how to be ma , there ?
and how to get you that trust , one that trust the parents , that the children , eventually got back from the bicycle <unk> and <unk> and other thing that trust of us , that we 're not permanently , where it , drive .
and our solution was , that we obviously a , of our parents tell us have so , where are the <unk> , so where is a car , where <unk> followers , where they may also a kind <unk> things , i realized that -- that is , you now , no way -- because we knew , so they are .
and we had to us between them with , let 's one hand , remember , but the other hand , listening .
and that you can now in here , not all the test , because otherwise it 's here , so according to you do n't more of have .
but <unk> , evening when they let 's light up and , in their bedrooms , or , whose bedroom , and then they orient to .
you can take a try , just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , is to orient and they 'll see , that 's at us humans as well , bats are also -- they 're a resistance to hear .
so how the bats that with <unk> are also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound of different <unk> will .
and this is for me in trust , so trust , in the movement , always very important that .
but <unk> as high <unk> to have and the safety , i ' <unk> chance , i think it 's <unk> piece to help .
and i just to orient no big trouble and i realized , without many accidents , the one or another , there 's course , .
what i 'm sorry , no pictures , i ' that i very <unk> itself is , from one of our <unk> , as children .
which is the climb on our higher building on 'm half a courtyard .
i did , i wrote , the confidence is also by a <unk> diversity .
and that my goodness ' i 've been very literally , because i was a man , the , much too much later in <unk> and in the <unk> with confidence in the scientific side , too have , i 'm about one thing i never , or i 've never that stumbled out how i do it ourselves 've experienced .
i ' of never been so you may also to drastically read .
have , but i also to do with , that 's obviously not everybody so , experimentally to see it .
which is the figure of our strengths with the <unk> , to some point to know , where i 'm going well , what i talent and where i can just mean that really too full <unk> ?
and our brother 's again , the have michael and i always took on top of the house .
so , then , okay , we ham 's a <unk> .
there you can anywhere from 'm window <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the by johannes was then right away , michael afterwards and i was , probably been still <unk> little bit like this girl playing , <unk> <unk> , i do n't .
but the last end , who is like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think , the other , we 're yes , the generation of the young women , here , also not .
and of so i 'm stop and yet , with .
and then was hold the consequence , we at all three <unk> <unk> up sitting and the dad with 'm used to 'm <unk> <unk> and did n't even more knew what he now , to tell .
because of trust is , then the way , when others doubt .
i had the father so , to god will , aid , aid , aid , about , the danger of relative size been , that one of us too afraid <unk> have and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i do n't -- somehow <unk> would be .
is , but never happened .
he had , then , so <unk> that he 's just as well , again , <unk> , or by johannes <unk> has to us , then returned , .
and that i found , i for me very great , that we do this opportunity had .
but it , do n't worry , this is not a principal , not necessary to later <unk> to do .
for me were the different <unk> , in my life has always matters who were all , interesting .
and , they were all this <unk> , because i just as you could , where i ' i was so my borders , what might be so my <unk> .
so to <unk> good <unk> i would have never be able to .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i go , until today is n't like in <unk> .
i go , until today get out in the rain .
now , not at five degrees , like the moment .
and at <unk> rain , but rather than the inside .
but i did ' time for me so this faith in my strengths with found that i different <unk> , well . ''
as the first for example <unk> .
and that was for me very beautiful , because there 's also the coach , the us in <unk> had , has said , ok , we do is louder <unk> children , but they send it ' us <unk> couple of blind children .
actually is yes , because there she grabs you anyway each of the coats .
and then you notice , yeah , what the other power .
and there was always been so my big trust , of course , right , when i the competition for place i 'm going 's hard , because then you can the others may yet , what do , what i do n't <unk> ' .
so there 's just a way , and this is the faith in my <unk> .
the other into a foot in the <unk> let me , yourself backwards fall so , the <unk> head out and then it 's the back and the competition is over , because it 's the full score is there .
i 'll do it 's not try out .
i did it i thought , but <unk> .
i think , this is now <unk> bit risky .
and i also here 's not a volunteer , right ?
<unk> .
shit , i <unk> ' already .
okay .
the next to me that was a sport during the school , just then the <unk> and you <unk> .
my parents were home or are until today <unk> and that you have us , trained as kids .
but for me , and in school hold it matters : how do i myself been much as well , the school move , in my excess energy out ?
and i was then as a way in the school <unk> to do .
and although i actually always thought , that 's all so , <unk> boring , because <unk> is something for the <unk> rather , <unk> ' i .
i found , i used -- <unk> ' what i 'm not anymore .
i then eventually , well , i do with the <unk> .
and i , then you find them , man , again , that 's the great diversity here in the sport , because you <unk> need , you need power , <unk> a coordination , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- they 've probably a lot of it also from their work recognized ?
that 's also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you just the full faith in the your technology .
if you this faith in the own power has -- so the force , that you that 's also then at every other conditions , the bad weather , the soft snow , the <unk> snow , on the skiing and bring it .
and if you in my case you know , faith in the team .
because when <unk> , the n't see , i course , depend <unk> <unk> .
and i still never that <unk> 's like today -- i have to the word to use -- my <unk> -- there 's , yes , just one -- has now , even my practice , done .
power , but nothing , we do you yet again .
or i <unk> 's and you now maybe just time .
do with a , one , one of them there yet another practice .
what i is always do the subject <unk> trust , is the exercise to the listener , just imagine i 'm like this is , if you do n't see that <unk> to make and with its <unk> <unk> .
so in <unk> <unk> , so , you have two sticks in your hands .
of so , right , i ' i do n't hand , more free , you could i yes , my ' <unk> take and myself the <unk> feel .
not about .
so i have to me different helping .
i then my <unk> and , the years ago , i 'm going .
and the told me with the voice , the way .
so the to just always the exact <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision somewhere in the communications , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me just always <unk> , if it <unk> 's saying , i <unk> and <unk> of saying , then , left to 11 , then i know it 's easy to left , so , so at the upper part of quaint at the pointer .
when he says , the left on top 10 bit <unk> to left , and when he says , right on a decade .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem because then i need again <unk> or it needs to me back again , then i know in any case , now is what do n't .
and to me is yes , this very large , critical , if the <unk> , i 'm going , then i have to me the really completely <unk> to a 's a negative to say .
the 's positive , to say , he 's for me that tool that 's me to , just really , then quickly to be , and in <unk> , faster than others , in the competition to launch .
and that i can only , when i 's just do , with both arms to me <unk> , i <unk> , on a leg gets to stand and i must now , really the eyes to make -- ha ha , or they can also open to make , is yes , nothing .
and to then you know that <unk> and to then on the other one leg and the same way back up , and to here <unk> bit in , but to actually , and quiet on .
also with high levels of shoes .
yes , and this is for me that very key , when i the <unk> 'm just : how <unk> i do it , the guy to say , so i tell the guy , because i actually just men as <unk> had , how do i 's the just to say , hey , you 've got me the right <unk> do , because the right , the see , myself .
the know so , what he tell me to .
so i 'm one , the him the way to communicate this open to .
and that 's like in any <unk> .
if anyone in my needs n't know , he can tell me , naturally does n't help , but there , i 'm just wondered , and have to say : well , i got , of you the curve , maybe <unk> <unk> used to <unk> .
or i got , of you like now , walking , that she told me just as well , says , how long , the mountain , is , because if we the <unk> <unk> , because you think , some time : now to it 's over .
and is again and how <unk> and that thing 's just not on .
and practice , i then we 've also , the pilot , as a 's the walking is , on 'm <unk> forward , the me then he says , we have unfortunately only 20 minutes of us , because we may -- so we ham the other times <unk> minutes to -- then we 're here we know , but again , rather <unk> .
of why is that for me , important , there 's also the this , accurate <unk> to have .
i listen , ' <unk> -- here 's probably another , the also <unk> <unk> driving ?
who is more ?
so my best thing was time , times faster , but that was in september , and now , so in april , may , i do it 's said , never been so much faster than done as <unk> .
and at the <unk> the moment , <unk> .
and for me , as i said , are those of <unk> only then you know , when i just mean your ears , frankly i ' .
the other me 's also exactly explain what he in order to see me and so the possibility is , my risk perfect an estimate .
and this is for me one of the very important stuff , why i say , trust is more training and not that <unk> <unk> .
so stop , it as a blind , not much , frankly i said -- from <unk> .
because i also been the experience was , that i 'm a <unk> right and left wrong cool for guys had .
and then it was in the competition at the bad , because it 's next to the way , three feet <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
of so -- as i said , that was -- of course <unk> on .
that i know , because the <unk> to , yes , around , to , so <unk> <unk> .
and i it happening today still be permanently , that i people say , the left and say , then , <unk> , the other left .
so i was then , right , unfortunately .
power in everyday life often not much from .
but it , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also all of the work or the university , like , and if it 's very quickly go to .
and then , precision , often , <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but for me , as i said , which is <unk> trust that , that i the risks we know .
and i must be honest , i am , who do n't see , which the size of the advantage , because i <unk> , my risk in many ways .
so the <unk> <unk> ' i now this kind of all .
the driving <unk> tree , from falling slope , down <unk> , the know what i and i <unk> , but of course , and this is yes , that important -- i <unk> ' , the good pages .
the which then also to be able , if that trust me just there is .
and if you who found , the 's really , a hundred percent of this <unk> , i 's just need .
and with the i ago , most importantly , the same people really have . ''
because this is for me in the subject of trust me just the next , very key thing .
you need the goal and i have just really also clear to be , what does it because actually , trust , go ?
because of this is often <unk> faster the term , you let 's used .
i have the or the or my own .
but the very key thing is yes , that it , too much depend on .
that you for that you to trust a lot <unk> .
and that you yes , too -- because we are all with <unk> <unk> <unk> meet -- we want <unk> sense that can see .
and the sense , the is very often , that we just also create , 'n goal together to achieve .
that we do it 's make -- in my case for example -- from some , weeks i ' i am i on the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i just , i have to me now , who are , the or the i in the case that trust it , that i just this mountain , up <unk> .
and how do you , then , that you on the mountain , some really up there is ?
well , i realized , i 'd say , the giant advantage , i , some things , not around , if it for example , beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
and then i was me relatively <unk> .
ca <unk> advantage to be , is heights , which is no problem .

that 's been <unk> bit <unk> , if you then there standing up and down the car stop , then you have n't been a lot see in , there to know , does now it hurts , if i <unk> .
and these things are for me , interesting been .
i realized , to also the <unk> to have , but to just as to know , hey , i war , of the , i think it 's so yes , focus , <unk> and you can just by but also <unk> new new experience .
and that <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because at <unk> mountain <unk> yes , so , you go every day , 10 hours ago , and it 's some of just , <unk>
you go and goes and has just rocks to , around , always sort of plants .
you take the <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun , ago i 'm half the first world war and .
so if you <unk> <unk> see , is the <unk> about the last , the <unk> .
the about and so the only exciting .
we have the <unk> of the distance ever seen or the other you .
of so <unk> ' i there <unk> great confidence in the <unk> -- despite his strange <unk> , that he and had .
because i thought i '' : well , so , as i said , <unk> ' i probably at the way , how to the that thing so .
but , it 's otherwise very <unk> , because you know , to <unk> actually now not so , much change .
and really exciting is that 's and then , yes , something hard to .
so if you then in the height <unk> and the air thinner .
or if it 's next to a <unk> , if you then <unk> little <unk> , where 's left , and the right <unk> .
then it 's particularly beautiful and if it 's and then also still accounting night is , and all with <unk> <unk> , has to us the <unk> , sometimes as well , now would he told me to the wire , so he then i also really in the view , and the grip .
because i as the only without <unk> there <unk> and this was him , but sometimes to be risky .
trust , we have this is created , that i just said , i : well , i can kind of course of mine who , my friend , the this was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> ' , and we have this before , <unk> .
but i got ' , <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently , focus to , because , can you imagine if you on the mountain and says <unk> stone , right , right on one , the left , 11 .
there 's going to some <unk> , and it all .
so it 's for us , faith in the case was , we 're <unk> connection , so ham , we have a wire on your backpack attached , that i had in the hand , and i 'm then behind her on the very loosely <unk> wire gone .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> , that i also with <unk> bit of the height of the stairs them have . ''
and it 's then eventually , only still , with the foot <unk> stone had to have with their <unk> <unk> stone <unk> , that i just as well , already know , which is so on me through and i 'm not permanently just focus had .
and what i it 's really has shown , how beautiful it 's actually , if you course , i realized then eventually , because the top , get , that you just this is really so again in the corner close to have -- just like , the <unk> , with the <unk> .
other thing is it , that i realized i , that trust , that i , i have , that is , <unk> just because , when i now really <unk> goal , i , as i just the top .
but that trust is also in other , the <unk> , like trust that works .
when we then at night of the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group , it forward and behind us are the other seven people walked and that were always a quite close behind us and it has to everyone to break , was somebody else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why would remain the because why this , and everybody , that he 's behind us run it ?
at night , you can also the girls not from the back to look .
that 's kind of not the reason , apparently .
and then i ' i think them , oh yeah , ok , right , their faith in their skills is degrees , some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night by the dark , you about 12 watch off , then the first , no light .
this is totally <unk> , if you <unk> is , the air is being thin , so really only still <unk> and now , no more <unk> first .
and then come , but eventually , so the moment , where the <unk> have said : yeah , man , that was actually , practical , behind you to go , because the friend of me , i just all explained , we 've constantly <unk> -- like that women <unk> this .
have all the night of us anything about and the other in the group had the right there 's also that the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it 's now just <unk> hour , that 's what they told me , then told .
or i did you what 's very different now not from the mountain on .
and that 's what to know , it 's still up there , the it may also just bad about <unk> that we have perhaps the time talking about -- it is only still <unk> hour , the sun is going on .
what these things , this also used mirrors from the outside can trust , again , significantly increase and you can just to contribute , that you so the personal medal of also done .
and to me is trust , all , then there and it 's in front of the perfect , if you know that the personal medal and that , what 's really do n't want , then eventually , in the idea of the right there is .
this is , right , in the exercise with the gold , in that you so <unk> -- i actually also not , why that an do -- maybe , i do n't , the value to test , or to look , whether it 's just to lead <unk> is ?
so i think , at some medals it 's so , in vancouver , that were six grams a hard .
if that everything from the gold would , <unk> i 'm not here , if i on the <unk> , think i .
or at least in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but , i think , the real , why you the power , is more that you can imagine : what i ' i actually degrees created and how i mean , skills and very focused on a point .
how i ' i in me in my skills , but of course , in the team , that we all need to care whether in studying , in the job in which is also always .
anyway , whether the old man or young woman , we need of people , in the we trust .
and if we then this is the head clear , eyes , and that 's also have achieved , is that the best of evidence , that we look at least in a project in our lives of trust us could .
and if you , once you can , you can do it 's also , definitely in other areas .
thank you very much
a science for me , is the title of my talk , from this is , <unk> of the beautiful maps .
what i 'm driving , is the very <unk> effort , the sciences , again as something <unk> in the general population likes to attach .
in actually took it could i 'm pleased to be .
if i in a <unk> <unk> , there 's all <unk> just with literature to scientific stories , the <unk> <unk> is .
even any <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where the major issues , <unk> issues , somehow , which the be .
every television has at least a <unk> , where some major issues of be .
even , that 's totally <unk> , if you 're looking , what it in magazines and <unk> for children there with scientific issues .
every program has somehow , a own <unk> in <unk> , but still is that a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that the can i 'm like to see , that can i 'd like reading , but that that 's 'm not themselves .
cool , is cool science , only way , on csi , in breaking bad , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
in csi so a <unk> five minutes , do n't come from the reality to do , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there , because you can i have to identify .
big bang theory , because i can about laughter , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's great .
this is too .
because , that 's kind of a little bit counterintuitive , the the future we 'll just manage can with these technological issues and themes .
but at bay , that none of the self .
i got a few little examples of time <unk> , like science , or science , just look at us as a given .
it 's a <unk> example , in london , you have a beautiful tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not so now , we build this time something like this <unk> .
what happens is , right now , that the sunlight from up in the facade into , i think that time <unk> out , is focused , and somewhere in other <unk> on a point <unk> .
that went big , through the press , there was , just a jaguar .
so sad , the heat it 's so <unk> , that this poor <unk> , the really long , long saved has , there are the <unk> <unk> .
there to ask you , this kind of an architect , the n't actually sort of times as a bit of what in physics have learned , because i mean , is yes , completely new thing that this is a mirror , things we focused on .
so , what i found have , new , is <unk> , somehow <unk> of christ , where he was supposedly , with the rays , a fleet <unk> .
because the question i really , what 's the more design , or an architect , or where he 's a ?
this is now a very <unk> example .
a classic , which <unk> of that are things have is that , the <unk> .
<unk> , that 's already now a few years ago , as it 's just sort of in the media got .
there was the train , <unk> , because <unk> changed the plants , that was , a danger .
a gene was <unk> with green <unk> .
genes that were kind of what <unk> .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's situations , where the market , farmers who actually become have : hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea , what it should be , yeah .
so , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can about discussing .
but to the time i was in the lab , active in , and eventually , frustrated , because i tried to have , these evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my then neighbor , <unk> , you see but not happy , in which is because this ?
i like this : yeah , i try there 's been three days as a little gene in my bacteria to transform and it works at .
this was , what i 've tried , to to explain , so somehow an <unk> , the genes , i thought , does the good that lady , when i of genes , speaking , you know them , what they now .
this was , what i actually meant , so a particular sequence , that i went there in this <unk> <unk> get to .
but it was the , what the woman has seen .
this woman has i never again , the hand shook it !
who knows what i want you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's <unk> .
this is now , well , 10 years ago , and yet , the way in consciousness ones .
genes , that 's kind of what <unk> .
<unk> i was very long , no more read .
it 's then the gene from free and it , but really in our language <unk> that .
<unk> can to europe , was a headline .
<unk> different lot of other , corn , yes , actually not genes contains .
one of headline , <unk> makes those rats to die .
yes , that was also a headline .
that are , but not so old and it 's also quite matter , on what level , i would be ways .
anyway , whether the time , or the picture , all talk from <unk> .
for happiness is it 's still not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid , it takes , no more time .
but this is simply , which insecurity in the population is , because they simply not to the issues <unk> .
nevertheless , we need to in our future us with these technologies are .
now i was just <unk> , nobody had the size of the subject , but it be about things are and one , which the most really no idea .
and it 's pretty sad .
what 's actually do this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this little bit , boy , motivated scientists are sitting in his lab , has a little experiment , <unk> anything , beautiful and well , and he goes down , you think , man , that is yet , what that interested , but the public .
then got to the first of the professor go .
the head , the decide , then , okay , cool topic , of his name on it as <unk> , that 's always important in the science , <unk> be .
good idea , i 'm still not in the public , it goes on a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh , great idea , class , there 's do a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , because we have a <unk> with a project , a nice idea , and that comes and somehow get out of ivory .
this will then <unk> , but at who really ?
now are these institute for rare alone , usually have multiple <unk> so a common of , a common <unk> .
and from all these are then the <unk> that really cool projects , then over the <unk> of the magazine had given , the <unk> , no matter whether it leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> are .
this is the way .
the basis will always on filtered , in ivory up until the , really cool experiments , then , actually speak of projects , there in this <unk> up .
this is that single give magazine , they 're really well done , there 's of all there 's free , yes , but who <unk> i that ?
in basically , just the , and interested in it .
in the <unk> we call it be the <unk> the <unk> .
so the that anyway , for interest , the <unk> then , the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
a magazine , reached the audience , the , the , for interest , and that maybe about an idea of , where <unk> it 's going to even in these articles .
who <unk> ' i so , but really ?
the <unk> , that it anyway interested .
the way that was now , the otto <unk> , i call him a gentleman <unk> <unk> , under the circumstances of the publications reading , i tried , it neutral place to keep , the <unk> i do n't really .
anyway , again , our future we 'll just sort of coming can , if we us with these <unk> engage .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , that are all these issues , the <unk> are , the gentleman <unk> but not really understand , and over the he somehow vote is .
my project , my idea is therefore , different <unk> , this little , young , get a scientist out of ivory to take , really completely out of its regular <unk> to separate , and he 's a course , to give , a seminar , how to science , which communicates .
what is usually happens , that a scientist , so i have a buddy , we know it 's been good about twenty years , he 's <unk> , it 's at us a <unk> rule , it 's not to his job to ask .
when he the mouth <unk> and over his career telling , he 's us <unk> .
<unk> , that scientists to tell then , what kind of <unk> .
<unk> , it sounds . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> is already nearly as the same level as the genes .
<unk> treated , that 's kind of , oh , you do n't know , which is .
the really teach , watch out time , that 's nice and well , if you on a conference are and there your people , your <unk> , on <unk> anything to tell you want , you can you 'd like of <unk> tell , blinding glimpse , time , say , just water that .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , this is my idea , these young scientist , still not so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , still a little more malleable are , the school , how to which makes .
that 's for all of use , <unk> , anyway , and investors , the want to also know , what 's the <unk> happens .
eventually are also tax , that there are used , so the to actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want you then also really , a jury , sit and the supposed to your project , imagine , your project a jury , <unk> , <unk> , frankly , even worse is a 's not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know , if that 's really is , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just tell you can , then you 've got it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and your project really to rethink , i can that normal , which we communicate ?
so storytelling is it already several .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in on each university , common , but also there <unk> i in which took all over the <unk> .
who , because for <unk> end of the city in the university at some sunday morning , up , there a talk to <unk> times . '' ?
these are the , that it anyway interested .
because i 've got back to my <unk> .
so , are the people , the , anyway , for interest , that there , drive and , there single talks sound .
that 's nice , there are any <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all these are happy , drive to home and this is it .
so down , i still on a second point , to say , it 's not in this <unk> of the project .
these scientists are also , trained , <unk> actually children ?
because many really <unk> have , , on the essential to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how children in their world , exploring , is identical .
children are working very , scientifically .
they do anything like to learn from the walk .
they try to , it work ?
<unk> , fall to myself , no way , does n't work , next iteration , i change a couple of parameters , do it 's still a new .
children learn , scientifically .
that are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which of factors i do to that it works or not .
this is normal !
but that have many <unk> .
and of so i think , really work can that only , after the <unk> it and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids out of kindergarten , from the primary school , there in experiments that make the children , on their <unk> , and , there 's really going to engage with , because i 'm convinced me , that the children and the scientists , in which took the same language .
and then you can perhaps , maybe some point , that 's my hope , telling the kids that then also to home , and then <unk> i also a gentleman <unk> , the , then also , for a major issues that interested , because the children with him that tell .
this is , then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his kids to tell him , something , that it <unk> mirror , <unk> worked has , that it 's a bread <unk> has , that it 's paper <unk> has , and understand then , and shake it may also the head , as an architect 's a house can build .
and not just <unk> i then , mr. <unk> , but the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it just in the first <unk> that i call to have to have said , yes , no way , so , <unk> for our scientists , that 's just not subject that have on the other priorities .
a scientist to yes , not able to communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , say , i the next to .
but who somehow , at work , <unk> is in a company , anyway , there 's in the next break .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
can fly you also not every day .
the last few weeks ago were terrible .
the weather , let 's a big bottom of the bill did .
in seven , soon after eight years , i had been , if i 'm here 's take you want .
i was before the ceo , almost 10 years , in the <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there are quite a long after the top has come .
we had <unk> as a client .
and for me that was actually more , well , this is <unk> .
what is that really ?
<unk> , this is actually a ridiculous .
i but then they 've learned , who here 's and that i am here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little crazy , but it 's on , too high , emotionally .
it 's nice and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'm going to you just in the next <unk> , <unk> minutes , a little bit of life of <unk> tell .
i 'm the ceo in <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
this company , there 's been 20 years .
and the ceo of the <unk> .
the company , there 's been thinking about <unk> or <unk> years .
that runs the <unk> here at the <unk> .
<unk> .
that a picture , that i do you here show you want , the little one point , right , this is actually quite as a red , so a <unk> on it , or anything , does n't know , yes , exactly this is still going to big .
so there is the only <unk> <unk> .
and of these are actually just now , 10 to actively .
this is already what .
there 's about 20 thousand active global <unk> .
so that is actually not a market .
this is also not a niche interest .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you do that then i really ?
how is that all ?
<unk> in valid and only 10 active , because we can afterwards , even talk about why this is so .
so very quickly to the story .
<unk> has a of many of crazy <unk> <unk> the <unk> here started .
so very short <unk> .
has to <unk> fourteen years ago , the first world war around <unk> <unk> into life was launched .
and then they were in the first world war , <unk> <unk> died in the way <unk> and <unk> , have been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
the have the london bombarded by and so , and so on .
and when we <unk> and eight , london got , and with a big <unk> there 's a <unk> campaign to fly , were the english newspapers <unk> full of the headline : this time you come , but not bombs , but in a peaceful intent .
so that 's the story because in <unk> .
and we had a 'm campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was n't quite enjoyed , because he suddenly realized 's gone , which there , and that really stuck , which old memory in there 'd put .
and you know that was to be for the marketing a critical .
but it was in london a great campaign , except the weather in the north up there was many years ago , very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not very much flown .
then <unk> two decades , <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> has that 's taken .
and has a <unk> for , then to america and delivered by .
that has a myth where , that all the german nation of , again something felt that has , which <unk> and <unk> that airship kidnapped , .
there was the then , in new york , receiving up with <unk> .
and the german nation 's up has <unk> , we are again , who .
this is in all <unk> so inside and this is that 's a little bit of myth of this device .
but actually are then to <unk> and <unk> only five , six seven <unk> even still were built and actually just two really big , the <unk> <unk> and the hindenburg , the passengers promoted .
passengers , a hundred , where about <unk> passengers , and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then i was the first broadcast live <unk> crash , there , unfortunately , yes <unk> .
besides the titanic that event , then , where a an icon , a a product <unk> is , and then also never more and then the flight .
also the different devices have been in .
and <unk> , <unk> the last still use existing <unk> destroyed .
that the materials that used for <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> : .
and then i was a long , nothing about <unk> years .
and then the had the <unk> zf <unk> and <unk> , that had the idea , maybe to the back to start .
and i was hired <unk> , because it 's technically a great product has evolved , we come in this , but the market .
yes , he 's actually a market ?
what is there 's actually go ?
so .
talk about we now .
the <unk> <unk> , this is perhaps , just to explain , we ham , time it 's still , <unk> , people have a lot of done .
there 's many companies , the out of this <unk> come from .
it are today <unk> staff , about 20 billion of revenue .
this is a real <unk> , and profitable .
there 's a lot behind .
the 've got me then also believe , here to come .
the <unk> to , is actually a very normal plane as each other infinite plane as well , but has , sorry , has <unk> a gas , the helium 's not hydrogen , and <unk> also a <unk> with <unk> .
is like a whale , the in the water on and the up , and the <unk> do to .
the time now is not there , that in detail to explain .
in this is a <unk> this in , with a structure .
there 's two kinds of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , that we are , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
the have it 's no structure and that are sort of how balloons , <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , the in the world , built was are , about four , <unk> piece .
and it 's only today , i said , only still <unk> in was minus to our own was , so around the only still two decades .
this is then the production , if a shell up being .
the left the structure , think again .
and the shell is also <unk> .
it comes from the <unk> .
source : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the origins .
it costs , one point two million dollars as a shell .
and is to <unk> , to <unk> be , and must also <unk> , because again and you have to yes , look , that if a these in it would or a hole , that 's not going to suck can .
there are doing the <unk> again <unk> do and look right , whether it 's going on holes are controlled .
and the end looks a airship that without the <unk> like it 's there .
the <unk> is so technically a <unk> product
and this is down here , the numbers , very short time .
one point where nine percent , one point where nine percent , one point , six , four percent <unk> , it means of a thousand flights in about falling , maybe <unk> from .
this is very very little and very good .
this is a <unk> .
that can to see .
but there 's a different trend , the us at about power and the have i ended up here on .
we had three years ago <unk> percent <unk> , when i started to have ago , <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may , we were at <unk> percent .
if you the eight years , eight years , <unk> <unk> and <unk> it to get to , then you can say at least in these eight years , obviously a <unk> the <unk> , also clear , in these eight years has to the weather clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can because the passengers , not by the fog and fly .
the want , yes , you see .
and the <unk> or <unk> 're actually every year , has been on .
so a little <unk> of the fact , that our weather , not just felt , but as well statistically , because we make the weather , every day , it changes .
but because that is , now this is that well , has the e.u. , a program <unk> <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars and we 're an essential part of this program .
i come today , tomorrow 's just come from finland .
that airship that is here on , is a flying lab to become .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between earth and <unk> feet .
that means <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> t flies by italy , to get up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many of hundred <unk> measuring the and analyzed the air , like that <unk> , as you to on our things that we the bottom of doing .
there , so i just explain , up there are we just with the second airship that .
a great a great assignment .
and it 's when you so i want concrete derived from the subject of weather .
it 's so very well .
and here , a few <unk> .
that airship on top of sweden , last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is the way the weather super , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> say that had they still never .
i did i 've got there just wonderful , beautiful warm days experienced .
the mosquitos who were then also not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have to de <unk> as <unk> diamond , for instance , better , volcanoes for instance , the <unk> are , the away is through <unk> through a million years .
just you can also ask , is , that 's all over africa , is that then a more sense if you make sense of questions , an idea of questions , of questions is it makes sense when you look at the theater at the movie <unk> or <unk> <unk> walked is .
because i time wondering , you know what do that really ?
and what are we think it 's really ?
the end , we were after two years , then also done .
the <unk> and then also not on .
the <unk> came back <unk> and this project was then they finished .
and a tornado , the <unk> at the mast , and then that damaged , that he also in the bottom be able .
i was , but not so bad .
we had 's very good insurance , and they were actually very happy .
that was , which is the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do with should .
yes , what today we do , a very quick <unk> from the kind of the <unk> .
what today we do , it goes and i just to , it 's about the complexity , it goes to ask , growth or was .
what today we do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do maintenance of course .
we have to the <unk> always get .
<unk> called an aging .
there , yes , and devices that inside , after 10 , <unk> , again , the have to be .
we replace them on the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about that we still .
we do we need to the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a general aviation <unk> the , the kind of the germans <unk> and the european we control is , to and the time , with <unk> how <unk> , or how also an airbus .
that 's also <unk> and it costs money and to and also get to .
the question is , you do n't really on ?
you want to develop ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
what do you think it 's really ?
she goes to keep in the market ?
you 're on the business ?
and that we have of course , in my time , try .
and we 've also some <unk> suffered .
how the way , the <unk> <unk> some <unk> suffered , and this bust .
the beginning to the <unk> stood still the donating of <unk> .
the population of the german , population has it was saved with six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship <unk> , and he in basically a bust , was , the population of him a donation done .
and it 's all the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the other companies from , otherwise we were or <unk> i today anyway , not here , and other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco to a client .
behind it was a very <unk> <unk> .
both of projects are , had failed .
so , <unk> .
the same time we have <unk> won .
and i not a picture that , because we that <unk> <unk> not yet can show .
but just in america is now the <unk> of the first <unk> in the ready to .
we have three and sells .
with <unk> that we like a with a partner , the technology , new .
and that 's a great success , but at the that you .
two who are in basically <unk> been , because it was .
why did n't it ?
we know it actually already .
either it was the location , not the right or the passengers had to go far <unk> or in america 's known to <unk> the last 30 forty years , the advertising did .
the ham , people have <unk> , have the airship that , have said , <unk> , again , again , <unk> , the power of advertising .
because we can did n't you there <unk> can .
and it was actually as hard in marketing that over to : hey , people call , and it flies .
<unk> 's good .
the pilots to transport the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but the last year we just <unk> done because of weather .
there are then the same , even half a million .
this is the bad .
the <unk> going <unk> routes . here .
it 's the point , of course is beautiful , if i also when ceos and look like the passengers get out and and and all laughing and we basically the also do n't do advertising , because this mouth to speak about and over again , we about <unk> sold coupon , and people say , this is so beautiful , and recommend it your friends , which and who also the further , in the family .
and we are great <unk> .
which i again and messy to the mistake , that you think we 're <unk> .
you could still more flights to do .
we have this is a <unk> the <unk> and we are <unk> .
it is actually also not quite .
we do , advertising .
this is a project has been , this an audi <unk> .
and audi has done that here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and you have to , sometimes , the <unk> imagine : do advertising and more sense ?
we have yes , enough ads , but the internet has a lot of changes , the <unk> the beginning to , because the <unk> of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , so there 's today is still 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one , put , that <unk> , three has <unk> bought , 10 are actively .
so then six of 10 .
that means we 're then the market in fact , even if one is to control .
and hope , it also again a future get to .
and what the end with david , scott , commander of the apollo to , after his <unk> paris <unk> and five , he has said , <unk> the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> 's nice .
ad to find we also .
only we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological value .
because we have any customers .
this is not at .
it 's <unk> , goes on and .
so , so a <unk> takes years until you the get .
and then there , it again years no .
there 's also very strange , the effect that easy for and hard to control are .
in any case is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the market , so actually not a market .
yet we 'll go on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power , it to do .
you imagine , just the question : in which it 's do it on ?
how much money we give up in the market ?
what do what do for here ?
in which shape is that they 're going ?
and i personally , they 've got me also asked , a personal to say , i 'm obviously ; my history <unk> , where , where i <unk> <unk> wanted , back against the big <unk> , <unk> has this little <unk> dead , just want , it 's also here to rescue .
i was also again , greenpeace was three years <unk> , when i of vancouver island , and i am and this whole <unk> come 've seen , has me that <unk> , that i there , i do .
and then there 's a <unk> about greenpeace , the money , being are and do n't know what they do with should , and almost it to actually gone .
there you me <unk> , the very to <unk> .
and i have three years for greenpeace by a <unk> and now i doing this in the hope , a long future in <unk> to achieve .
zero , this true ? forty seconds , i 'm still done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
that 's my three key points that i in the <unk> minutes to talk to .
why we are today , from or in the abundance ?
how we come to <unk> ?
and , especially , what do ?
so what is there 's really ?
we start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a depressing .
but it 's also the drum , the challenges to show .
a few years ago about , that , harder was that , to explain .
that we have a problem have today , you know every child .
that we are environmental problems have .
but it 's worth , always been over time on <unk> , are the challenges that growth for example .
all kinds <unk> is exponentially up .
if you do it in a historical long view looking , the oil for example , it 's a very short episode in the history have been .
the moment we can not imagine , that 's kind of different is , that oil again and keep up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , once there 's time <unk> , so let 's the last <unk> years .
that you can also <unk> at , <unk> ' i also , right .
you can also say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it goes , then , if you , a little bit more specifically with , to sort real challenge , the things that 's really to avoid the , otherwise we 've just have trouble with the <unk> , at the health .
<unk> called it 's a few days over 30 degrees .
and there goes , degrees ' in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> , and increasingly further , bad .
it goes , but also the <unk> , , in asia .
you think of the himalayas , where the big streams <unk> and the <unk> of them on that there and continuously water from the himalayas is coming .
it goes over the end not the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , there 's been much bigger and crises .
and <unk> , but it goes to us to the people , the sort of in in an altered the ecosystems , <unk> will live .
it 's about the loss of biodiversity .
the deserts <unk> , from .
the freshwater that will always be less .
this is the aral sea , where an essential part of cotton , from .
and all this , where does this from ?
all these bad things , say , i time hanging in the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
with the , what we total of the earth up , what we harvest .
not just , the oil and the metals out and the minerals , but that renewables , raw materials are in renewable , but the last end of scarce .
and we should just look at that we so little as possible that one of that 's also last end of waste and cutting emissions to produce .
it 's so about this is in the introduction , i 've been the <unk> really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just c o two , <unk> of a car on a different but really differently to live .
another way to economies .
our technology , completely new to change .
if we still time , just look back the hunters and collector , and there 's still on the earth societies , the in principle that life , come with a ton of resources in the year per person and year .
in a <unk> it was then in the longest time the human history , three to five million tons .
today is it to the <unk> .
so <unk> has to this <unk> .
and he 's very , unequal around on the earth .
it 's in north , more than at us at us still more than for the earth , portable .
and in other parts of the world , you look in africa very , very much less .
and to come , we <unk> the impact at us , the rivers , the air is much better to become in the last decades , but it 's up in basically it , that we in other parts of the shift .
and the other parts of the world 's , that , but , less like .
and so we 're also the conflict , we see , of <unk> , is , afghanistan , where , you look at them on the maps of the american geological survey , and then you see , where the resources from .
and this is there is it 's very colorful , which means , there 's lots of resources , there , where the <unk> the world .
so if we do with this messy , want , then we need to us with the subject <unk> .
so we have to change , the ecological limits of these are everywhere , the <unk> is everywhere .
and that , what we here at <unk> lives have one is not <unk> .
that has been of mahatma gandhi , were as he has said , the world has enough for everybody needs , but not for everybody greed .
and there are we , like here in the average life , much about it .
so .
that was the kind of <unk> part .
but i think , that you the needs to understand it 's worth , what to change .
even if i there would say , it worth it also like it is so , the way you live , which is more soulfulness .
but it is , and again , , from the <unk> <unk> you need , a rationale , say , i time .
so , which is actually soulfulness .
and since we need to find that we in our can share the world that as much have reached economically , socially acceptable to quality , on standard , us in the average often do n't feel .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there 's people , and we know it 's safe , people , the not so good deal can with this story .
i have time and there .
<unk> and climate have the same cause .
we 're going to a lot and to do .
this is the one side , we get yourself in the stress , and eventually it much .
i 'm also very much like .
and on the other cause we just this <unk> .
what but then is a good life ?
how do that define ?
now it 's sort of a scientific <unk> .
and that , what i 'd been told you have and what i later tell me is science , <unk> , but here is it 's about it 's drum , how can i that , first time , what ?
and there 's important , to understand the quality always has two aspects .
the quality have the aspect of the objective conditions as it me goes , what i 'm going to eat .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i was a relationship , i can the life to participate ?
but i just as well , is a 's me , so , how do , i myself with the ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived quality .
and then <unk> ' i two words can bring , the at the place are important .
this one 's needs .
the needs are the very fundamental dimension of our human development , our there is that 's drum , feelings .
if we our needs satisfy can , then we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , needs are being or not sustainable .
the needs by se lead , not to <unk> .
what needs ?
you can kind of scientists , quote , i got here 's only two , called .
and there you , the physical and needs , but also need for safety , social relations .
for protection , to participation , after <unk> , creativity , spirituality , for freedom .
it 's a bit of what do with money to do .
but to a big part of actually not , but the question is , how can i in my life up .
and i am at the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy , i 'm using the me to have is to me that needs to meet .
and there goes , then , drum , that i can , with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
because i can be much money we need or a little money .
strategies that are just my behavior as i mean , needs <unk> .
that has with my values to do , with the resources , with the possibilities , that i .
if i little money to have 'll ' i different from my needs to try to satisfy as if i , much money on the bank account .
it 's about the first of the <unk> , is the roof over the head , to eat , and then , the <unk> .
and here is , then the drum , it with a lot sooner or a little <unk> , and that can kind of sustainable , or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies , the me available to stand to my needs to satisfy , <unk> then talk , we by a lifestyle .
so .
that was the kind of scientific <unk> .
and now it goes you what we can do now ?
how is a 's how about this ?
and there 's just a couple of evidence .
obviously has to this sort of , everybody for to myself out .
but the evidence on the individual way on a technological way , here is , think , i , a lot also about technology is actually been and finally , on a political way .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides at first have sort of words , the danger is that we were at the more affluence and more resources , they consume .
last end of the quality of them back down , because , the effects and worse , sort , and on us the last year after all back to beat .
or , whether we do it 's make , sort because in a different way to go , the with less <unk> , may also with less than consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my <unk> , may recognize him some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so more lives with less <unk> .
there 's a 's a lot of the technology as i can every single thing , that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee , the car , the traffic , how can i like that make it ?
cement , i can now you produce , i can the house of wood building , etc. etc .
in order to significantly less <unk> more or the same life to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> has this is expressed , the <unk> per <unk> , and there are we look at the , which is also have time talking about the is , there 's a 's very deep down there on a 's companies to look .
where are actually the needs ?
that services , i can really satisfy us ?
and how can i that , as little <unk> do ?
and it 's not with a little bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there are many examples of that , it can .
in vienna is to a building be built with two decades <unk> .
with seven <unk> it 's in <unk> already built .
this in the essentially from wood has .
that you , if you maybe it in its years , no longer need taking it and then again in its parts and not sort , this sort of very much less resources and consumed with all other people together , you that sort of the moment with the half and the goal is with a fifth of <unk> , over the whole lifetime of the house was with this one fifth of <unk> long .
it goes , but also a lot in our own , , that <unk> ' i really ?
<unk> <unk> has a book written , <unk> .
where he shows , how hard it last end is sort of really from the from the sort of this <unk> out .
the <unk> , i want to me , sort go the others come after , and then i sort forever , in this in this race in it .
you -- has sort 're , that i quickly <unk> , and then pick , i think this new .
the most <unk> ' i the <unk> , that you know of all .
when i institute , who started have a few years ago , we 've still letters is written .
then you have sort wait to be able to the letter back to write , i <unk> email , is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
to write , i hundreds of emails .
and i can be very much longer afford .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we come in to that .
but i did n't really time has saved .
i have to me and <unk> done .
but there 's good examples , slow food for example , where i really , the claim the quality and the claim the <unk> in the foreground , in place .
and with a low <unk> more lives to do .
one of my favorite examples is <unk> .
there 's a best-selling , today , you have all , that <unk> average person at us in germany , in austria 's tens of things in your household .
you can just start to count .
who , two , three generations of tens of things had , was having employees , personal computing .
the have to the managed dissent .
we need to myself to deal .
and fewer people come to realize , with these all options .
and we need a raising , the us that helps , the us and <unk> to those few things <unk> .
about , think , i really interesting , it may also , <unk> application of the spacecraft 's go , think , i , not getting tens of things .
the next example is use instead own .
a real boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> has to sort perhaps , 20 years of , in the alternatives over been developed .
in the meantime , use it and more people , if you , <unk> thinking .
if you , <unk> thinking .
platforms , business models that easy to work , how do you the things that we already have these beautiful <unk> here , the front of a few hundred years was built still , use and still about the other centuries , to use all about it 's the last end .
that which even invested was just better to use .
this is the last end , a question of justice .
i did you do this sort of how profoundly unequal , that 's take you that as a picture , between africa and europe and a a <unk> world .
you like that all the same with these resources economy can 's only then possible if we can use less .
and that means that 's not less quality , because of us time already , to a lot of have .
but it 's an important task of the economy , the company , these products , those services to actually available to imagine that we need to us a good life to do with a much less resources .
last point , that 's also something with the great public policy to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i the time .
if you a little attention to the projections to read , is degrees , again , oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week are these projections back to the bottom <unk> .
it means , yes , a crisis is , the door , my view , and after , what we , very much , economists , talked and so busy have , here are the numbers of austria , you find that , for all countries growth , just after the bottom .
and there 's no reason for growth to have , so , as i do this from my adolescence , from the sixties years know .
for part that , in math reasons .
one point five percent growth is so much like eight percent growth of its recent years .
and that eight percent is that , what china today .
that are also about there , where we may be in its recent years were .
overall , if the pie bigger is , of course , is harder , times eight percent <unk> .
this one percent is still too , so we will be good living .
but you to , on it up , that means not even if we zero percent growth would have , would be that , the next year , just so much of and consume and incomes to have like in this year .
that we can be good to invest and so we can work .
that 's also why not so wrong , because you have these statistics have to show that growth on , for , not more with the quality of them together .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in in <unk> countries , about the state , on the we are .
and the way as jobs are also , without growth as possible and that 's not so closely , like that gives us again and of <unk> and how they all this suggests is .
it 's just not and then you , and with the economics <unk> .
and it 's coming again and and more , that is also <unk> like the format , or next week , think , i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with this subject to begin , through .
already <unk> , edward <unk> , the day , nobel peace in his <unk> so <unk> that he has said , the good life , the good business , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
all about it 's the last end , and not not primarily in the returns to create , not primarily to grow to do for our countries do n't even more about .
for the peru , and these countries , for china , for india there is that <unk> very different story .
and that 's going to just then you will also under <unk> , if we there , sort still growing let and we just sort on this level , on this high level , on the we 're good to live and economies .
it takes a 's also about politics .
it targets .
it takes some indicators , say the economists .
it 's not just sort of this growth , but we should really look and measure and ask , what 's actually with the quality , up the to ?
is the down ?
and then also our politicians to measure .
of course , as high , is the <unk> ?
how about this , together ?
we need a essentially one aspect of it 's the <unk> finally to tax avoidance and not the work .
of you in the entrepreneurs of them , but also the employees , you know that very well .
what sort of control the walk away , we know , even a colleague , paid .
this could you very different do .
the resources are sort of reduces and why are the resources <unk> and not the work .
and you have to the last end of <unk> bring to something to create , to <unk> to ensure , health , infrastructure , without growth .
it goes , but there to you , a little bit better .
that means , the conclusion , more or less , on all levels of it in this way we worked , we can better , we can be a company , the right products , services as a consumer sort of us questions , what we need really , how do we do that what 's sort good for us ?
what we need and what do we may not ?
the right politics vote , the framework put them .
a couple of evidence , i gave them .
and the last end of course , the science <unk> percent of <unk> is still in the direction , how we can that growth , boost ?
has it 's not done .
if you that the look if you the development , look at the last 20 years , it 's always , down , because it 's not about .
the politics , do n't and the <unk> not going to grow and create , but this is the question how we go to the to , which is that we have a good life of have ?
so , <unk> 's do it .
ca n't be the <unk> you <unk> to lake .
with heart , the brain , hand , and the last end , the <unk> we 're going to do .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this city .
this town , so many stories to tell .
one of it has to , a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving i 'm going to , and on the story about later .
they 're going to do have to the fortress <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> , here in the middle of this city is , and much of this city , is , and <unk> .
one another story before .

a man is , like , in his shoes , so , that it right <unk> .
that to him 's warm .
he 's the europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he does then one he pulls the shoe of you take a knife <unk> also not long <unk> in , and it 's several times makes them there 's a lot of holes in .
he pulls the shoe back to have to be a knife way , and notice he has a climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe , the breathing , born .
and this number , that you see here is the point in the <unk> of these billionaires are on the mario <unk> today is .
a business is <unk> from , with four letters .
the , or another one of you know it .
he 's the original idea , nike and adidas offered .
both have been rejected .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own business .
<unk> about it , the stock market .
doing now several thousand employees in just three hundred business in about <unk> countries the world .
so much for the subject of creative problem-solving .
why not something to make up , which still not there is ?
and mario has , maybe the question for the , with <unk> <unk> it .
if you <unk> still do n't know , it is for what it 's a chance ?
this question that 's got me , which helped , in difficult situations .
if something wrong walked is , or my collaborator <unk> me or the technology does n't work or what 's also always .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what is an opportunity ?
and it comes to the <unk> into <unk> .
what do you can <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and a different example , by the <unk> <unk> now , which is the <unk> us from <unk> .
and the evidence , like creative people can be , if it to their own insurance does .
i want you a few examples here show .
that are so in fact that was at the <unk> <unk> and that has to it also an ad .
i <unk> , the awesome .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .
he 's just <unk> , this is the wife by the <unk> <unk> .
or i had all the day , plants <unk> when i the intersection achieved , grew up a sudden a bush in my <unk> and i could this one vehicle , no more see .
so very clear , who 's this guilt is , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been , and two , almost died .
because they can see me , but at least that half <unk> on .
the last i was at the crash was n't blame .
blame was the young woman in <unk> .
if you a man who are , is each one another explanation obsolete .
if you , but a woman who are , you know it anyway , not .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream of that we all the more of creativity to use .
a lot of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that does not be like this .
why not things just a different to do ?
the old stuff , that we do , the routine and are , the us , maybe we 've got bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why the not just a different to do , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there is it so <unk> companies that using this .
for example <unk> , the have yet these <unk> of their they are , these signs , or at the wall , for example , and there is then maybe so what on it .
also a way , right ?
let 's the coffee order to stay instead of the <unk> .
or so what .
we have no <unk> , <unk> you .
is yes , today , <unk> , right ?
if you the phone , not something you can .
or eat them at me , otherwise , starvation , we both .
rude , but creative .
that it 's .
i about ' one of the client or an the then go to and say , okay , that they like me .
that <unk> ' i .
a <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> the current day <unk> , and it in <unk> .
once the sport , the current news , one policy .
if you there 's three on the <unk> was , is you <unk> .
even got the complaint about to long <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs take all the hands of to do .
it was to look closely .
the have thought , collectively , what we do ?
how to solve , we the problem ?
we can not faster , in the kitchen .
this idea is born .
on every table is a <unk> <unk> <unk> set fresh <unk> salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so , that , the an in the wait on here we eat their <unk> have time -- 're able to .
just a different .
a creative idea , and perhaps , with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person that does is not just popular .
you that person is the leader , the <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and now <unk> yes , the german orbit .
and the second day , this is still on monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> to the staff of the month elected , and you know , maybe , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us to consider doing <unk> .
the buses that are full , it will <unk> run , people together , in the carpool , because each of course , another , because for , of a is , b to come .
but why do n't let 's also now to use and creative , from his disadvantage make something ?
sometimes it happens , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> might find out , in this company , that you know .
so we have yes , you know that 's where the <unk> n't really goes well , but that you in the <unk> also , saving to is something <unk> .
or the <unk> in the car .
because we know , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why is not a piece bacon the car on , if you <unk> is ?
or at <unk> there 's also the ways , the creative and to design .
and all that has to do just with humor , with joy , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son , at me in office .
and sitting on this <unk> before me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then turn it from left , right , he 's delight , and i in my stinking <unk> say , to the you stop , that is yes , not a playground out here .
he said to me , looking at me , big eyes , a playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i actually , he 's right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground today ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for adults ?
that 's about , but very much more sense , right ?
if we are relaxed , are , if we our talents to use to do that , what we like to do .
and so <unk> make , but it relaxed way .
this to is that , when a particular day , the week , then it changes , what in our brains .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow it 's our focus on one another day .
so one other day , we have , rather .
so in the weekend .
it sounds , yes , already in the media .
the <unk> is yes , just a day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time of the year , announced that , the vacation .
what are then the rest of <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's awful ?
we 've all this horrible jobs ?
a <unk> had time on the front page made , this topic .
yes , monday , you can ' i and the rest of life , you ask ourselves .
or on <unk> , on facebook , all over the social networks is this issue up .
once <unk> i through the <unk> , one of <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i look at me that would like to .
what have the way in the <unk> , what 's because it ?
and one day <unk> i 'm going on this business with these <unk> to buy .
and the first sign that you see here , this is yes , actually quite neat .
so , with this kind of love to do instead to work .
i <unk> that yes , i 'm a father of five kids , but i love , my work now .
yes .
or a <unk> for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that your mindset , the , because it becomes , which is always more and always on .
somebody has been there 's as an answer to that direction , posted it 's not the monday , it is your jobs .
and i ask even in fact , with the pink , glasses , this forward to come and say , okay , ' time a shift .
what at my job is beautiful ?
this silly , is , a 's the pink , glasses , is , it looks like all right out how do before .
so something nice to talk , that 's not nice is , it works , obviously not .
the pink , glasses , is the great for bicycle on .

but to <unk> <unk> they 're not .
where is us that , if we do n't that change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
inside of the company , outside , <unk> .
it ends , maybe in a system where we so similar to us feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this wheel , and running and running and goes , and eventually it 's going to quickly , this wheel , it caught the mouse and it over out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know , nothing else , she goes back in the <unk> .
and again , and again , and again , maybe the movie day <unk> that <unk> you might after all of them , soft .
it 's nice <unk> here with hay , so they do , yes , there <unk> and it goes over and again , so there .
and that what we as funny feeling probably has the mouse and a concussion , yeah ?
or something needs it , that <unk> <unk> .
i was a 's many years ago , so when i way was by a seminar to home .
and , turned that the street under me , felt it was very , black , my eyes and somehow got to ' i stand still remain .
the next day , i went to the doctor , because i thought , which is there on ?
he looked me and said , way , it 's physically , everything okay .
but how you look , with the <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , the to check , and saw , i worked for three weeks , and somehow <unk> me , the job .
after 20 years in the <unk> and the participants , as the first in the early been wondering whether we 're looking at night before , finally can do .
i also thought , what 's actually , otherwise , for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again , other priorities to , to look , that i time with my family <unk> , something good for me -- i do .
<unk> ' , whether it 's not <unk> other <unk> there in my job , a new <unk> .
i was , the talks , large groups that make me , pleasure .
i do ' , as a counseling and <unk> and other things , but those talks impulses give to , experience to share , the prepare me , right time .
and that was n't always been so .
i got myself recognizing to that this <unk> stress sick of power .
and sometimes it 's really this shot in the <unk> so , <unk> of me is it back from the hospital , i had been , after he 's a heart had , and , so he also , <unk> .
sooner than i said , you do with some jogging , he 's me , <unk> , yes , you with your running and so .
today about it themselves .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in real <unk> , but eventually we will also , together , jogging , go .
what happened ?
in the bottom line , we all the healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , this , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the <unk> last 10 years , <unk> of minus its percent , that 's nice , this is less .
the rise of psychiatric disorders , plus <unk> percent .
this is something , where i think , to that be ?
why is that ?
it 's just in austria as it ?
no , also in germany , it 's .
<unk> , <unk> , this is all healthier .
this is so here on the left to recognize .
it down psychiatric disorders of plus a hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a a big german <unk> out .
the number <unk> drugs , takes to .
also the cost .
and it just think , all kinds of official , what we can do with this topic ?
do to them , sometimes form , it , involuntary <unk> , for example here .
so it 's good meant .
and somebody once said , no alcohol , is also not a solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is that , what makes us , again , healthy , power and it and with joy is ?
and that 's got me the last years busy .
i thought , there 's something like <unk> , it 's something that all there ?
i 'm <unk> , the job is not that what we <unk> is fulfilling and happy to do .
there 's many other things that are important , family , health , think , and so forth .
but in fact is yet , that we the most of our <unk> in the work on .
and if we do that , why then not that do , that 's time for and also by the other .
the <unk> <unk> ' i do you <unk> , as the last , offer that way to <unk> and to <unk> to .
these little had , that you , hopefully then it easier to notice .
<unk> is for talent , those , liberty and environment .
that means , <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in which environment , ' i think that , with whom ?
what kind of freedom , i ' i 'm here to do that , what i do to ?
because it 's the degree of the <unk> , the us <unk> .
ever more of them , <unk> more stressed .
and what do i do it ?
that those .
this is where these four areas .
and everybody can for yourself doing .
i had this for me -- check in front few years , and i do that <unk> again and .
i can make my talent use ?
in which environment ?
and that means that sometimes do i in a cafe with my laptop , the seminar to prepare , or a <unk> .
the freedom .
what kind of freedom , i take the to do , what i really matters .
and do i 's also ?
the those .
the last u .
and then there 's and again and people , the me explain , why do n't that goes .
and why that at them much harder .
then i mostly , like an answer to this is .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't , has the reasons .
and by at the point you can to pick <unk> ' i ways , look , i way or did i reasons why ?
and they 're in both right .
what we do so with our talent agent ?
each of them has its large <unk> around .
that is yes , too small .
that 's filled with a talent , with the gold , with all sorts of , with their skills .
what do it ?
by the end we ask this .
or if we the hospital is or the end of a life .
what i with my talent done ?
incidentally , who 's got has to <unk> <unk> , can like to there 's still access .
so , what do with our talent , is so my first question , to me to myself , which is every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was , but still something with a story .
that i to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i want to the 'm still do .
the fortress which was the rescue operation for the <unk> as long ago <unk> <unk> years , the enemies , came .
and the enemies , we realized that the fortress so well , built was , that you do n't take you could .
thick walls <unk> ways , the <unk> to the fortress , which the doors , <unk> , this <unk> .
i was <unk> back .
so we thought , that 's what , okay if we do n't come , and we have a <unk> .
we let 's no more out and pure .
let 's look how long , that there , endurance .
the <unk> it was from long until the day came , where the <unk> almost any of these were .
they had just a <unk> the was already on the way to slaughtered them to be as the <unk> , to the bishop says , the bishop give me that <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , you have you time , i <unk> , you , come , take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> going to the <unk> way .
, look down the enemies , how about the wall of the fortress is a <unk> there is led to and again from left , right , and in the early .
well , thinking , the , a <unk> , what is that .
it 's <unk> .
again , is a <unk> <unk> , up on the wall of the fortress , this is it , black .
enemies , think , oh , the still has two <unk> , it can ' , to take you .
the night , the same scenario , time , this is he knows the <unk> , the there on and ab led to .
the end of the second day , after the six different <unk> 've seen at doing it in a <unk> off .
because they thought , it takes us to long , that we think we have no more .
and then went to the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one , they had and the they <unk> .
it is the <unk> <unk> born .
i like this idea , that everything there is , what we need , and that we all .
sometimes it from the resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's a little bit .
but also , so we can but do something .
we have no idea of the power , we have the world every day to invent .
and if you believe that could now a good <unk> be then they 're right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know that goes away the snow , there is a 's warmer and there 's start with the plants , of branches brown <unk> to green <unk> to be .
there are blooms eventually come out of those blooms fruits .
there are apples . it 's very popular that we then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of corn we can then grind up and bread , baking .
there 's any animals , the eat .
there 's people , the then the products just to it later , food .
and it 's automatically .
but if you think about that it might not so naturally everything is then it a fear and <unk> .
and of course , is this threat , maybe just very abstract and also a theory , but just in the blooms , the connection of the flower to plant are bees fly a very , this huge role .
there 's research , the show that , to <unk> percent of our food , at particular food does n't there were if we do n't make bees have .
also the sounds like this <unk> , because it this natural for us is and we 're bees might also did not as well .
there 's now , some time , a very interesting movie , <unk> , the subject .
and i recommend you look at it in .
now , but look forward to the gentleman <unk> of which is just with the bees are working , the in school , in <unk> the importance of bees and power .
that makes it here , a school in <unk> and he will let 's a lot of his work to tell .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
first time a big thanks to mr. <unk> and at the whole <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> or <unk> to contribute to the living in the bees .
and that still under a wing of <unk> something about a little <unk> to tell that makes fun .
because i assume you can , that the most of you <unk> <unk> are about it now today , tonight , <unk> do it in <unk> minutes in the basics of beekeeping bring to .
that i do n't , no .
but maybe that 's me , you to bring you to these <unk> start to love or a certain amount of empathy them , to develop and you to engage them for this <unk> <unk> , <unk> insect the <unk> .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years young 'm with a wonderful woman married , father of five kids have n't <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and work for <unk> years of <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and the group <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> above of <unk> with our oldest students in <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in the modern agriculture and in beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play by <unk> <unk> and act of <unk> <unk> .
we 're flying classroom is more a <unk> , a silence , a steady thing .
and it is also to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not free have been the ancient greeks the relationship between honey so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> know .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , describes it as the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the sleeping poet out to inspire , that it again , thick can .
but the <unk> go there is n't have to myself , but they send their blue are bees and <unk> now the poets , the lips , with the wax and they crawl into the mouth , in , and back out with him later , the words like honey from the <unk> flow .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully you get me that 's evening .
yes .
this flying the classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the just now my students with me , we 've come for 30 to <unk> days in a <unk> .
in <unk> schools of us in <unk> to college or in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> to <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> or in classrooms with us in <unk> .
the teacher , the this project with going to me in the class , and we 're looking for a put room for this is a <unk> .
most of the window of the children , you can see during this month .
and of all things , with the bees , then in there are by the up out and again <unk> can .
there will then the window of a set up created .
so .
and then starting to the entire at me on the <unk> .
i 'm so a <unk> and <unk> ' so far from an existing <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> you now here in these <unk> in .
so important in this on this <unk> are <unk> so the bees .
also important , we have here <unk> <unk> , and here to the edge , fresh <unk> , so fresh eggs .
and then you also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey inside .
the need them , if a bad weather is , and they do n't fly you can .
so .
this is that then .
then comes the <unk> here again on and immediately is the transportation of this <unk> places , or at the for <unk> place in the school .
and now start seeing something wonderful .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there 's the then in the class on experience of a crisis .
you people 's not anymore .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and that 's the most important task from <unk> , when he made this <unk> order to that it on attention , that the queen , in ancient people 's left .
that so on these two <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they start , <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they now almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen together .
and now starting a <unk> .
my ladies and gentlemen , one night developing now you now the need , a new people to form , and all that happened without <unk> , <unk> , without conferences , without having conversations , without opinions and you .
there is the people , agree and you then in the first night is a <unk> .
because without the queen going to that people , after six weeks , not exist .
because <unk> lives only six weeks for .
so .
and in this first night to bring them from one of <unk> a pencil out an egg , and bring that in this <unk> in .
and there <unk> to then <unk> queen going .
everybody from them <unk> in the high had to say , how do that go ?
yes , genetically <unk> , is yet all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now start seeing something wonderful .
this an egg , what 's normally in the <unk> a <unk> become would be in the <unk> a queen .
the egg , has the first three days in the same genetic code , like the <unk> .
after that will be fed up from a <unk> <unk> .
you know that term .
and instantly it changes , on this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> going through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had that i 've just heard that , what we eat , that determines , what kind of us will .
and at the queen is that really wonderful to experience .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .
and that the students all <unk> .
that you see in class .
and then this cell <unk> with a <unk> wax and the whole thing happens then also , because that people now , democratic to <unk> or because of <unk> says , this is it be , you <unk> a group , you do this now .
no , that happens <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> decision .
and then for the students to eight days , my graduate student knows , three five times eight a queen 's doing so <unk> days that the queen <unk> .
and the day , if it 's so then to happen to , the teacher , it <unk> in the <unk> there <unk> the <unk> at the students get up to five o'clock , yes .
and then he says the mother , say , which is because with you go ?
yes , i have to in school .
yes , why , because that ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then the morning about six in school .
and then turn of their <unk> down , this <unk> , because they <unk> want to the queen 's now <unk> .
and if you that really to experience then hear you first thing .
the queen <unk> .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then get the <unk> and cutting the queen 's free .
the first , what the queen 's doing , they 're looking at their wings , and there are now with their <unk> that people what to myself a queen 's moved to have their own smell , you <unk> , their <unk> .
that people who has now , an identity .
now are three to five days for the queen fed orally .
the <unk> the front of get them their <unk> <unk> .
and back from the <unk> out , from the people , from this <unk> .
and after five days going the queen 's one of the <unk> out .
some of thinking now , yes , i did here has been seen , such a <unk> in <unk> .
hold , stop .
what 's completely different .
-- that let us .
the queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without <unk> , from this <unk> out to two miles high .
you have certainly been seen in your <unk> .
in the <unk> and is there in a great <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so the way around like in islam , where the man different women have to this is the queen , the seven to 12 , men .
and the whole thing happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone will come from the back <unk> the queen , and the queen 's being now in an flight , all that , what they 're going to seed need to for three years eggs to put them .
for the drone is it also an amazing experience .
if you 're done is to the <unk> dies , and of dead by the sky .
and then comes the queen and back and starts , eggs to put them .
there 's always a , two students in the class , that immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .
and then turned out to the project in school because now going to the <unk> again <unk> and the queen and the <unk> that will now to tightly in there .
and then come to one evening , then before to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> of the outside , and the next morning <unk> ' i do this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and here you still the queen .
yes .
then <unk> .
and around , 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then you get this , these two <unk> are now here in a <unk> .
in a full cane , in a prey and now , that people , and <unk> be .
why the bees in the school ?
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , the kids that had to forget that never more .
yes .
there 's not just like that in this class , students that the time with the bees are together , but the entire school is yes in this class in .
and the teacher , when he something know , when he something can , when he if , he 's a little prepared has the can an era after the other join .
look at the bees and <unk> <unk> ago <unk> years , we have the cave paintings , where the people , the honey and it have .
a few months ago , you have in israel <unk> years old <unk> found in which the people at the bees that i have .
any human culture has to bees <unk> .
or the other way , the bees were in every culture and .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece in rome .
so they were in .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> join , he can a <unk> join .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , you know , which of flowers , or the trees , the bees <unk> , what they need ?
that it out there 's something out , now in summer in the modern agriculture .
it out there , that 's a green desert to bees .
yeah ?
he can make ourselves with the students in the <unk> go and flowers are bees <unk> , the <unk> you mark and look , how long need the right now , from <unk> to my flowers ?
how long they 're on the individual blooms ?
and how long they need , until they come back .
he can <unk> <unk> hold .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
you know , whether this is , in the <unk> the peak , the top is , or <unk> flat on the top is ?
let it 's just go .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can with the students , even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> discover .
and then you get it to the question , was karl from newly <unk> the nobel prize in getting ?
because he thought , has to the bees that can see in the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's <unk> .
there 's also a bee 's nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , the many years in <unk> at the university teaching has the has in <unk> <unk> , that the bees , there a <unk> creating on a single <unk> .
as a <unk> the web , from the wax in the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , <unk> there a , and the bees , the <unk> , the up with their legs , with their <unk> .
you see , what these bees in the school to do ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the kids lose your fear of the bees .
and develop an awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , look , what the bees do .
and they get a warning of these creatures , what the actually took only for us who lives .
the bees do wax still not a 70 pounds per people in the year .
in <unk> years , the only way , candles make .
they accumulate in the <unk> out of the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , with the <unk> you people from .
and now imagine if they time ago , in summer , that are <unk> -- , <unk> bees on this one narrow the room , <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's infectious diseases , without end .
no , at the bees do n't .
because they have in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they collect the pollen , and so that it <unk> , he goes to <unk> , one able <unk> .
someone , the at the <unk> has is , pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now to a <unk> go and , a <unk> prescribe let , by he the <unk> from the people <unk> .
obviously there 's a before , and with <unk> with a <unk> and so , there 's nothing .
yes , and then i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that pollinating the <unk> do that the bees course , and we have fewer and apples , if the bees , there 's not fly would or we have to be like the chinese , just on the <unk> <unk> and they have pollinating plants .
there 's much more what .
you look at the <unk> , out there on the meadow , is the also the growing on the <unk> , where the cows graze again .
and that flies underneath the bee and , up to their nectar and it 's fermented and that <unk> .
and now the cow and <unk> the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> pick up , they can digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> you that back and notice , ah , yes , i did <unk> <unk> , ah , i can it again <unk> .
and there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and to good end those the bee 's the most valuable , what it on the from the nature , there .
the honey .
i want , quickly to the point where are , <unk> .
my students to be happy , every year , if you these <unk> building and then in part with me , together in the schools , go .
that 's now , not my <unk> but once i had a student and and i said , <unk> in school in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> , put you yourself .
and then he says , yes , i hot , <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> in <unk> and i 'm about 20 years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and since two years , thomas in <unk> .
and i 'm ' me , that i now , no longer with the <unk> learn to , but with the hands of learning can .
<unk> , with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> school .
and more than half the said , oh yes , that we want to also .
my students see here 's an enormous appreciation and the put between , in <unk> , the normal and the <unk> people get through the bees , as .
on the field to meet them , and they have confidence , my students and a certain proud .
how come to the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how come to the <unk> the <unk> ?
and because i think , i , there is the person , the other people <unk> and he would have a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , start with it in .
at a poem from <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee , would be the sun shining through the <unk> feel the way to flower will find and never the direction , you lose the be the fields in <unk> gleam of how quickly he also lived , he 'd ever cry .
thank you .
hello , love her friends in all the world .
welcome to the presentation of my project .
this project of the person and my wife .
it 's the struggle for an end of the female genital mutilation .
in my eyes that 's greatest crimes of humanity , because it <unk> been <unk> years .
the society against the women , we still have six give a day .
first <unk> ' i imagine .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
there , i <unk> years of a <unk> .
you can think that i was the job , not <unk> has .
i felt i do n't <unk> .
and that i was glad that , i in the subject <unk> well <unk> and exciting so <unk> could .
for example , this .
with a massive <unk> the atlantic ocean of africa , after brazil .
on the sail a plea on the <unk> brazil , <unk> genocide in the last <unk> indians the <unk> , to prevent .
that was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
yet we were like so be , that interest in the media to find and even a person as i was his cause the world to the language into .
<unk> i do with their own caravan across the <unk> in ethiopia <unk> .
at that was there war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we were <unk> of the killings .
and despite all cruelty , that we were , with we on the other the infinity hospitality of <unk> , the us into <unk> , arab hospitality .
and it twice did it that we invaded , and our two <unk> , you see here , with their bodies as living <unk> of us <unk> , and the <unk> said that 's my an .
if you the killing want you do by us , shooting .
something like i was in one another culture has found .
and then in boys , you 've learned , that you islam is not going down to be able to terrorism .
and christians who want , not reduced to be on their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but rather on the real value , like a charity , social responsibility to the <unk> .
these are the values , for the , it 's worth to fight .
after many years i 'm again in this <unk> been , together with my wife <unk> .
and then we then from this <unk> female genital mutilation .
when i then i heard that <unk> percent of everyday victims <unk> are the rest of these christians and <unk> i ' i thought about how can a <unk> like the islam , besides all of terror , that still <unk> in the shoes and push this ?
and the idea was born on the top leaders because of islam to bring the need to sin to explain .
we 're looking for <unk> at the germans organizations , that we have n't found .
because we had to us , then you listen to be we yes , completely <unk> , of islam is n't <unk> .
you would give me the throat <unk> .
on <unk> of amnesty , and internationally , we have then <unk> our own organization , who started .
and were of <unk> and <unk> independently .
and to now this battle , even get to do we needed the images .
it was a lack .
and so moved <unk> and i went back in this desert to do with the hidden camera on these pictures to do .
the bad bloody images , that i 'll show you do n't , but i want to the crime , drawing .
girl , the age of four weeks to go to marriage will look at some of their parents and related <unk> , on the earth are placed you sit down to the limbs , and you , without anesthesia , the clitoris and the <unk> ab up with a <unk> the <unk> to , without anesthesia , with <unk> instruments , no knowledge of hygiene , and the anatomy and the <unk> to <unk> .
what you this is a set up from the size of <unk> .
<unk> is now one minutes .
if they typically get <unk> you two weeks .
never destroyed in the body and soul , <unk> their dignity .
this was the beginning of so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> is a 's on .
the man to them open .
he 's still never a <unk> she saw .
the uncle have him , oh , ibrahim , is no problem .
you <unk> your penis , <unk> , and then one you very hard .
and if you do n't it can , is also not bad .
then take you that knife and <unk> them on .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of the girl .
that you had , three months <unk> .
in shock , the girl its language lost .
these are the <unk> , also some in asia .
the most are <unk> by .
and when , and we are muslims were , why you have this is done ?
i was the <unk> answer that we need to do that 's in the koran .
nothing is in the koran that , in the opposite .
everyone , believing <unk> five times per day in prayer , one <unk> , the creator , is , perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe , what they sit there praying .
they <unk> <unk> , a <unk> to be the women 's wrong , has created and why you , well as <unk> person <unk> could , to women <unk> .
but now we had the images of the first <unk> was this <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there 's hard discussions , two days before long .
but we had the health in our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then the great decision , the practice is against all rights , against the religion , we need to him to ban them .
as recently , the way <unk> this new <unk> signed .
and if you africa and the <unk> know , know , you just that has to these people very valid .
and it was celebrating , and these successes , we had then also in other countries .
quick example , <unk> there <unk> us the highest spiritual , the <unk> the country , his message that 's a crime is , <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were the way , with your <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had this .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical , saints hospitality experienced .
and when we do this country , eventually leaving to , said the big scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to really all <unk> countries to happen ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you do n't know , there .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and you have to slow to the thing to come .
and , he had an idea .
he said , if it you get , the ten <unk> muslims , the world to a table to and the explain the need to sin , it 's a sin .
<unk> and i went to the cairo , in the <unk> and -- the mosque comparable to the vatican , the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he listened to the idea of was thrilled , especially , when we his notion , that we pay for would .
and that 's do you know about <unk> , the us support .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference , not just <unk> , as we put it 's about asked to have , but i 'm going to the <unk> take over .
and that 's what he did .
over cairo <unk> some point in <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> to go on the <unk> of the female body through cut .
the <unk> of <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> .
and all are they did .
a hundred <unk> , but the top of the world .
in the middle <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe , he 's the cause of <unk> because of cartoons .
so men the life and death to decide what we can .
but you also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the top of the world .
about where i 'll <unk> me just still a vacuum , and <unk> personally .
and then i 've all of them a .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at the <unk> from left <unk> of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of woman mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much for the subject , of islam is not <unk> .
we were also the medical <unk> the on their way , time <unk> , terrible , you women 's in , with the <unk> .
and then you for <unk> your film to <unk> .
reality .
the men had the wet eyes .
they , back behind <unk> doors , just two hours , you had decided , and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> is going on the cameras , announced , what you decided to have .
and the most important set in it , that was this .
female genital mutilation , is a <unk> crime , it against the highest values of islam <unk> .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done , but the calculation , without our <unk> done .
because the shame , the abdomen using the woman to talk , is that remained as any mind .
that we have <unk> .
we have that we have the conference , documented in that we call the golden book .
a <unk> for the <unk> this world .
and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it so well , i found , the book , he 's it with a , blessed .
it gets us from the hands out .
we were in many countries had to conferences have to the time on <unk> .
and they read that with interest in some were so thrilled that the book <unk> have .
unfortunately , but i have the most not the courage to put that well , to announce that .
the abdomen using the woman can you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some of the courage to put them .
they 're at least in the universities are gone , <unk> .
and sometimes we have a bold <unk> found the fact , in the mosque about <unk> have , here .
and then it goes out of speakers in the <unk> .
and that yes , the affected .
the will spread .
but i 'm going to the time .
it are all drop in the hot rocks , and that i work in many other strategy , this topic , <unk> .
the practice <unk> .
but my <unk> that was this .
i want to the great message the highest <unk> the world to announce the birthplace of islam is here at the kaaba , in mecca .
not so <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if you here four million people come together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with all that and the <unk> king of my transparent up there is between the minarets <unk> .
how i that 's been trained to have in the <unk> .
unfortunately , lacking in me , the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he of <unk> would it up .
, to these women to help .
the other , to the time to show , which the real value of islam is , instead , and demonstrate to make .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i do n't that do then <unk> ' i may have this , what in hamburg , its had .
that at least a lot <unk> in the mosque up in all the world .
and we transparent , there <unk> could .
and maybe <unk> i do it 's still , that little girl , his daughters , no more <unk> to .
then we have to my life that really worth it .
and i want appeal to each this , now ours , or have seen , to join .
also not join 's been a <unk> .
we need to the practice in the ton step , otherwise <unk> i 'm here from this stage , not .
and now , i want to you end by the concept of my <unk> been able to show .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .

down there we have it also in german .
female <unk> is to the koran , and the global ethic of islam , incompatible .
it 's <unk> and one of discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i start , so , .
so we looked at the <unk> , that you as a refugee , in germany would get .
the <unk> attention <unk> have my mother , my brother and i the first time that 's a package <unk> .
it <unk> <unk> .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't understand 's why the us now <unk> food have given .
the third day , we finally <unk> .
we were the trash to this stuff back to throw it was a <unk> wife and <unk> that easy to <unk> .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
this is not <unk> .
it tastes like even very good .
it 's a cheese .
my mother was the eyebrows up and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my country , we have is <unk> but the 's not so <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
ago to years , i 'm with my mother and my brother of china , germany , and fled .
of escape <unk> ' what i tell .
but , about me about to the people that run to have and to a success did .
but first tell , i want them , where i just come from .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> , the northwest of china 's life .
and this region is from the chinese that autonomous area <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> miles from germany away .
in china to live in 10 million <unk> but in munich , is the <unk> community of china .
and these <unk> life , so here because we in china under constant <unk> suffering .
hundreds of chinese were extra to <unk> moved so we in our own home to a sizable minority and are .
our own native language , <unk> was out of education eliminated .
in schools and in university will only still in chinese taught .
and our religion can we also not free <unk> .
the <unk> losing so their culture and identity .
and when someone brave , is , and for the right the <unk> in the risk for sentences , torture , or even after death .
that was also the reason why my parents for that we decided to have , with us kids to escape .
this was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is just in front of escape from .
we did n't enough money , so i had my father , first time behind .
i <unk> ' at me many people , the us at the run have helped .
i <unk> ' at me many images .
i <unk> ' me , but first of <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> , it 's going on me , when i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had <unk> <unk> , and more and we met him , with his little <unk> on a parking space .
the first rate was to .
i know many of a negative image of <unk> have to the only do business to refugees use and not for the fates care .
but i <unk> , say , i <unk> , it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> has us several months by .
he stood on the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last thing <unk> , whether we also really sure , through the <unk> up .
airport in <unk> we got there , and i know , as my mother of , to me she 's just get out the airport .
about you do n't .
until we out .
because i had this is in my hand a pass , and there was also my photo in but there was an alien name , <unk> .
i had a <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> ' at me <unk> <unk> the me <unk> he had my watch out in the hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long view .
we were at <unk> .
in munich , <unk> ' i want to a lot of the first responders , we somehow , and have .
i <unk> ' me of the <unk> woman with us in <unk> used to have .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 family .
at least forty children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
it was stranger faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> share .
there was being eaten , slept and homework done .
friends and now , not to visit , because i <unk> , where we <unk> .
just mean <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> knew that 's .
they knew my story and went to me , and they took care , to me .
for example , it brought me to <unk> <unk> what i now not more do .
but it helped me , somehow , german were to meet .
i spent my whole puberty , <unk> .
it 's for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us kids , her husband and always in the uncertainty , because we had , just a <unk> and were any <unk> be .
i <unk> ' me that i really , aggressive , was to the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , this now here 's all to tell , but now i have to just to my story on .
i was really aggressive and i could make me in the school at some way to focus .
that brought us first to the catholic <unk> where we the first time with the normal young kids in touch were coming .
with a normal , my ' i kids not in a <unk> live , had .
i <unk> ' i also on the <unk> the me and my brother and so , or <unk> sent to have .
just so we bit out .
i <unk> ' i also , several <unk> <unk> the with us at that made , because our parents do n't speak german could .
or the have to us just made .
we 've always very was .
i know yet , how we always before the fence line up and waited until these people came , because , sort of took the foreign people for us time , and that was us back then count .
after two years , came finally , my father , germany .
the problem was but , that it directly from <unk> to <unk> relegated to was because it in munich supposedly no room more for him there .
i <unk> ' at me the very , who lawyer , the done it has , my father , the <unk> to china to keep us they made it in fact , that he was at us in munich to me .
i <unk> ' me to that time where i really , then , very glad i was , because after six years <unk> to we finally in a normal home to move .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally , a own apartment , your bad and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was that is very small and i did n't have desk in , but it was good , i could my door gates .
and i <unk> ' me that i the time , yeah , very well used have , but i had yet the <unk> without a major leave .
i looked for me really no way .
there was a <unk> , the me in <unk> , which has and it 's still do with the idea that i think about the second <unk> my degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i appreciate the teacher , that really at me thought and i was really not just to the time i managed it even up to the middle <unk> .
and i came to <unk> .
and before i 'm going to <unk> , i played the way with my best friend <unk> at <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of the organized <unk> .
but i was no good <unk> that i ' i also only done because we <unk> a place , where we just going to .
we had a valve matter , what we <unk> <unk> could .
and the ladder of <unk> helped us of us to our problems to tell you could and he went to us , and could tell us in all of questions of <unk> .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and that 's a project , where young people without a closing the opportunity to get to artistic <unk> .
that 's what i really very well done , and i realized , art is what i 'm also a little <unk> .
by <unk> and the connect to <unk> got a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie <unk> about life of my friends and me .
and the film he won lots of prices .
we realized that the people to our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we do it 's still never had had , that people 's listening .
and that was so a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more <unk> .
i want something from my life make .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees came to me on the idea , to a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but there , i in the <unk> building me completely lost , i ended up to be in a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and this thing is , after a performance , two editors , <unk> <unk> on me <unk> .
and asked me , they did , if i interest should have just your <unk> to do .
i thought , super , <unk> .
you do , i with .
and i made for the <unk> <unk> , pulse <unk> and one of posts about a play <unk> , in the i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> nominated vice versa .
and i 've got it also actually won .
by studying , i look at the school for <unk> and movie munich <unk> already in the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and it would be for me not been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me to be used to have .
they have to me believe they have to me spaces open , they have to me ways that , i had my place in the society , i <unk> can .
and to come ' i now to them .
each of you have the way of people like me to help the second chance to get and their lives or their place in the society to find .
because , the people , every day come <unk> hundreds of refugees , munich , and each of you 're full of hope and each of you have a huge potential .
they have it with great determination to many terrible hurdles , behind . to make .
and with this determination , could you really big profit for germany , and for every one of us too .
and i could actually thousands of things tell , what you can do , but because i no longer enough time we 've even though there is , a minute its , i put them a <unk> brought .
<unk> you now your phone out , you can i did n't tell is , they were no code <unk> can .
scan it the code , and then they come on the side of <unk> with many suggestions , what they way we can do .
and that would us right of help .
i <unk> me now have time for their engagement and we see us out , i hope .
and then scan it the code .
i <unk> , it .
many have the phone , not in the hand .
are you so i 'm become , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yeah .
just a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
you me , that we connect to have .
my name is a robin eggs .
my <unk> 's going to be easier than it , talks .
i come , of austria , that 's in vienna .
i <unk> ' i still very , today in <unk> be to get to , is really beautiful here .
i <unk> me here every time , very comfortable .
and this is not a phrase , that 's a sense .
yes , in contrast to the other <unk> i 'm not here today , to you about anything to <unk> .
i did n't know , about .
but it is that i text write in my spare time and then there 's talk , mostly in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or just <unk> like the today .
yes , and i was also today i asked , here 's a couple of text to read , the all this program a little <unk> .
and that 'll ' i now here to do .

it tells the other yeah .
he <unk> ca n't <unk> me .
here we have this level mandated .
the first text is a little <unk> , that i just written gotcha . ''
i , it was a person dedicated , that i made partially and what has .
it carries the title <unk> .
and yes , it 's at themselves will not understand .
when your head in my lap , we slept under your rest of my ceiling .
my leg was also under my ceiling , your leg , was outside the ceiling .
my leg , was for the ceiling .
it 's about her head is to be on my lap <unk> , the rest of her the ceiling , my leg , the ceiling , her leg outside the ceiling .
that has <unk> , about my leg is extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the text , i also at a person dedicated , the me , which means .
and it 's my grandpa owned .

jesus is the only <unk> is the sticker there to the slice of the bus .
but where it was the jesus as he told me , that sticker <unk> , saving to ?
there to think , yeah ?
i mean <unk> been brought ?
soon the text .
the next text is a little longer .
he takes nearly half hours .
so to write .
and reading , you go faster .
is the beginning of a novel , i degrees in the <unk> write . ''
ah , it goes to <unk> guys , so the adventure , by a guy , the , again and the hair <unk> and a little to a lot <unk> .
i <unk> ' me , but again and at this point of the <unk> i distance .
because i <unk> ' i never the hair dyed .
chapter one .
if i <unk> is my mind of empty .
so empty , like this piece , that he now to fill it 's trying .
yes , and i 'm not come .
very hard half hours .
the next text is also a little <unk> .
most people understand it .
i do , i myself too hard .
and it 's the , i play , like to my vocabulary and with my language .
i , always been like to me playing .
and yes , come to stop these things out .
it carries the title <unk> .
is a little bit strange yet <unk> .
is probably the <unk> <unk> , that i 've ever had written have .
<unk> we can .
yes , we come .
we all can .
we <unk> .
but i ca n't .
but i can do it .
i can not .
i can not .
yes , i do it yourself also did n't understand .
no idea .
yes , <unk> of me .
i say , always either of or no one .
the next sheet , has also do with text to do .
's kind of this is a little <unk> .
i the back to insects there .
very polite .
yes , 'n text .
is a little <unk> .
and it 's about a cool , when i was so , that their three , i could .
my text is the title , all good things are really cool .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> so dry .
<unk> we <unk> <unk> .
so to , stroke , <unk> , <unk> and from scratch and then is the better and yes , this is it .
beautiful 's a moment .
yes , 'n <unk> , that is this one of other .
and it 's about a cool , when i was so do , that we all so <unk> of <unk> could do , so 'n try that all time .
right , so , what the wind power <unk> .
the text is the title <unk> and about this .
yes .
it makes fun , you .
the <unk> text is simply just a sentence .
i write , so like little <unk> .
this is a <unk> sexual pun .
sexual response is to <unk> s written .
<unk> s ?
yes , yeah .
it makes fun , you .
yes , 'n sentence .
the is in <unk> written .
is a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible , <unk> in <unk> to explain , this is the point .
here , text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he 's already know , before i do it as such <unk> have .
he served me <unk> of a up , then would he told me <unk> let me .
i could make me later , in him <unk> .
i told him the joy .
it as <unk> , all other days <unk> and me back to sleep placed .
with a <unk> <unk> the face where else ?
and purpose , it 's not anymore to honor , by i <unk> .
and should i later , back up , it can to do n't need to a crappy day i acted .
there hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what she albert einstein , when he would be a steak , she ?
i q .
so .
the letter q and that sounds like the cow .
so that 's funny .
yes , the text , has also the paper , her learned .
is more what political .
so , i write , not just fun things .
i write , also partially very political things .
and it 's going ' i often wondered , where i <unk> ' .
and , because i ' i just this text message here is written .
he 's the title <unk> .
my dad came from vienna , in my mother and i from her .
yes .
we have the <unk> .
thank you for the sound .
yes , this in <unk> ' i 'd like a bit of ads are doing .
i can see me , no business or so afford , so i have to that always <unk> do .
and it <unk> ' i also -- events and i <unk> also have a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
you can actually like a show up .
and yes , i <unk> , i <unk> , actually very <unk> .
and , yes .
that you want , i just have said .
it goes on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little advertising , i time i wrote i .
feet .
rich in vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin toe .
it 's very funny .
i want , a joke about the <unk> your friend and writing , but that punchline that was just go .
yes , is not degrees , my <unk> .
<unk> you <unk> to stop the <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk> to make the <unk> <unk> of it .
yes .
thank you for a 's listening .
you were terrific .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me the same with a <unk> question to start .
why do you <unk> actually do ?
i mean , everybody , the tax used to the questions , if he least some potentially of society which give back to be .
the answer is very clear .
we know now , that the life expectancy for at the birth , just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> is .
that means it has to any environmental impacts , <unk> give the impact on <unk> .
why do we still so little ?
why are we were bombarded by the <unk> messages from the <unk> that to be part of each <unk> ?
you remember , all , to years seemed to the <unk> found .
it was fat .
you thought , if you fat from the food <unk> , we all <unk> and be healthy , old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves , with different <unk> in america supermarkets , led , and what does it changed has , that the americans every year 's thicker become are .
then you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the carbs .
then what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so that lead .
it becomes so , and <unk> new <unk> sow and it 's a village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
well , the reason is , for my taste , part of the least that we <unk> <unk> approaches <unk> <unk> to scientific wisdom <unk> .
typical situation for a <unk> alone is here .
the <unk> you know of all .
<unk> published a lot <unk> magazine , a new <unk> .
the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the next year .
keith richards , was seven years for the number one nominated vice versa .
and then he died in the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest man , the in the on earth has lived .
<unk> years old become .
i know , there 's some people argue , they are six , can but on their <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> become .
and they listened to <unk> on to quit smoking was , but with <unk> back at the then finally , <unk> <unk> the path of the virtue to follow and stop to smoke .
with <unk> is they then he died .
which tells us that ?
not that , cigarettes , healthy .
but it tells us that , aging , very complicated is , and that we need clean , what do we need a simple experimental systems and we have to be easy to ask .
ai very simple question , and a very simple issue , the in different countries preserved is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know now .
this is on testosterone at <unk> so what in the male <unk> produced .
and there <unk> very simple as evidence for <unk> men are that old as women .
can now everybody for themselves to think if that a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a free land .
but it are still better tips , not afraid .
general , shall we 've got correlation , <unk> to confuse us .
it sounds complicated , but it 's just usual <unk> to illustrate .
there goes to so somebody <unk> <unk> grandma , and asks , what you have because so different made , or you ate is , they 're so old become are ?
ah .
that she has every day decade of cigarettes <unk> .
this is probably the secret of their ages , right ?
and have the decade of cigarettes , maybe just not <unk> .
or , but they have <unk> and that she would happen without the decade of cigarettes , older .
ourselves hard statistics are not always <unk> .
there for example <unk> very hard statistics , that shows that people , the <unk> in the <unk> visit the older , as humans , the that does n't do .
do .
is <unk> .
is that the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because it , that the people just enough money in the bag will have to the good to her age and the <unk> diseases to take care .
if i but one group of <unk> a <unk> to feed me give and this group to 20 percent live longer than just group taken that the <unk> just do n't get it , but otherwise , exactly the same thought was then i was actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet by .
and indeed are these attempts did was .
to tell you , the <unk> is very <unk> at , but even i do with my enemies agree that 's me is that <unk> fast that life <unk> .
and that work for the different organisms .
for example , bacteria .
you <unk> <unk> of bacteria .
if we the fast , in the <unk> line showing then life , and longer .
the same is for <unk> , <unk> fly , mice and recently was just kind of about two years in the united states that even for the monkey is true .
this is a 's not about , skinny .
it works as well , <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and this is another experiment , in the united states has been done .
what 's what you did here ?
you have just <unk> , and has one of this so-called <unk> to , a <unk> diet where you so as many <unk> one day and night get it .
and who you wonder , here , the mice are dick became , sick and have <unk> very bad <unk> had and bad <unk> .
now , you have <unk> parallel <unk> and that 's the right in the same number of <unk> fed up just that <unk> <unk> break .
the have the day no food to , for you have at twice as much eating .
and these <unk> now is <unk> and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
although both of mice <unk> is feeding were .
both have a much eating .
the a sick and the other healthy .
what happened there are really ?
it 's a process called the cellular <unk> or <unk> on .
whenever they were organisms , or the cells , food taken away then she catches the organism , <unk> ingredients in the cell or degraded ingredients in them to turn it again , energy to do .
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see , in the cell in this . <unk> are mainly , to <unk> , the during the ages <unk> .
the <unk> then with the stomach the parts are <unk> and the cell as energy back to apply to put .
it will you damage the age , accumulate in the limitations on .
this is quite the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell .
so , it so <unk> fast <unk> that live in different organisms .
and it 's probably , embrace , that 's also in people work .
and we learn from this is , they just not like in <unk> recommended , every little <unk> the day with two <unk> fight to .
no .
but , they should have to say , if you 're hungry , have , ah , maybe going on the <unk> on .
welcome them their hunger , as a friend .
and it 's also <unk> sense .
while <unk> point where nine , nine percent of human history has the human , what did , if he was hungry , did ?
right , he 's a hunting gone .
we go out regularly look at the fridge , hunting , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe to the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is : , but the meat is weak .
the garden looking for us very different from .
here , of <unk> <unk> in a medieval garden that .
the three <unk> here 's a 's good , the food , all day , let , and serve .
and that 's kind of the actual <unk> .
we 've so on the search for substances done , the molecular and of <unk> <unk> though the organism , eat .
that could for people to be interesting , whose <unk> is not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we may , one of the hardest <unk> of life to preserve .
so the question is we can the <unk> , the <unk> , the cellular <unk> turn , although you eat ?
and we have a lot of hundred , at the thousand substances scans , natural substances .
we have in the fact , a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a real substance , the in all those organisms that naturally is the but also in all these organisms during the <unk> less will .
in the skin , it 's the <unk> .
<unk> people have been much less <unk> in the skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells there , for example , then you see here .
this is <unk> is cell , here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> on and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell of the <unk> , the during the ages <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells were all that look .
and this works in different organisms .
here for example , shown in a <unk> .
so we have <unk> substance found that the molecular <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
life , because the organisms , so , no longer .
and the answer is again , you see here <unk> typical <unk> of <unk> .
it are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are the all dead , after forty days is about half the dead .
whenever we <unk> to drinking give , here in actually going to the animals grow and surviving better .
we also know , that human cells , that we of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have in culture , about three times as long to survive , if we 're going to <unk> putting it .
and the latest research that we put too close that even the lives of all over mice , <unk> <unk> will .
and it 's not only that life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now you want of course , all know , where 's <unk> ago ?
how the name , says , it 's the sperm being discovered was , there is in very high concentrations ago .
but i can you <unk> , in <unk> fresh green pepper mushrooms cheese , and a product of <unk> <unk> , what in japan , big <unk> <unk> , that 's <unk> <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we then , if <unk> against <unk> helps , by it the <unk> <unk> helps it might also , <unk> ?
they have to because we know that the common denominator of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we have in the did experiments that made .
they 're going to wonder , we have the on fruit flies .
flies , which is also <unk> , if you 're old .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you old will .
and the molecular mechanisms that for remembrance of these are very much like the people .
now you ask , yet , how to the devil has the guy , the memory of flies measured it ?
this is the experiment , what we share with stefan these types of the university berlin 've done .
you take a fruit flies and they suspend the here , there are one another , they love .
<unk> .
and let that in this <unk> <unk> .
then take the same fly to give them in the next chamber , and give you <unk> different smell , they love , which is <unk> .
we do you make the <unk> enjoy , while , but <unk> <unk> <unk> .
classical <unk> .
then take them back the same fly , do that here in .
the driving this degree in the elevator , down , there you that .
and when it down here has come are , give them from the one hand <unk> and of other hand <unk> it .
where you go into the all to ?
it .
the <unk> .
except the two here .
the <unk> .
or , we say , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i want , i 'm not by this <unk> <unk> reward <unk> .
okay .
is , but <unk> form of the character , the with the age increases .
not just to fly .
and we could actually the <unk> of flying through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , and back into .
and the <unk> , the brain did was , were back : .
that means , <unk> does n't just to aging , but also to <unk> diseases , maybe .
and that 's important , because we want , yes , the <unk> not the lifespan , by se extend .
it does n't make sense , the time the <unk> to extend .
and i want to do n't you had , you a few practical tips to give we might younger , stay .
still time <unk> fast .
it 's not about that you weight on or so .
there 's the way now in austria <unk> group of <unk> people , the one day he eats , and one day , do n't eat .

and keep the very well , through .
that means , it 's <unk> .
and avoid it <unk> .
it 's not to carbs , complex carbs seem to do n't be dangerous .
it 's really candy .
you know now that <unk> <unk> 're going to get diabetes <unk> , even then if you <unk> are .
and you know , that sugar the growth of tumors speed of it .
here you <unk> <unk> , the ago , the ages .
after 30 days are the all dead .
so very low doses of glucose rich .
for a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , it works in almost all these organisms that .
food they regularly fruits and vegetables .
avoid them the gift of a lot <unk> or of <unk> ever .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer can deploy .
this is not under the circumstances for them vitamin d .
we 're here might degrees ' in winter , <unk> , because vitamin d is by sunlight on the skin , educated .
some of them at least three times per week <unk> half hour of sports , that 's really trivial .
cigarettes , despite the <unk> <unk> examples of the cost you <unk> 10 to to years lifetime .
do they 're in times of the eternal <unk> occasionally the quiet .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is to .
because the monks of lives almost as long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> lives are still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> die , sooner than <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume that 's what do with some substances to do .
no way , no way , that 's very simple .
if now here 's a <unk> the window is then <unk> ' i the with <unk> <unk> solution that way .
and what 's like that 's probably in your <unk> .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what , going through and alcohol , the circumstances , there <unk> .
so we have , alcohol , especially <unk> <unk> impact .
a permanent partner , or just 's family with longevity associated .
they should n't look at a lot of the busiest streets you live .
now you think the same <unk> .
this , but with <unk> n't have to do .
it 's about <unk> .
you can measure the closer to somebody on a lot of the busiest streets the type , the more <unk> he 's the blood .
and that 's also , when he says , i got me time you 're used .
i can already fine to sleep and the noise that makes me nowhere .
not true .
he 's still more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
sun radiation to <unk> be because <unk> course .
we know now , that <unk> very good metabolic effects .
in front of it that the <unk> down .
and we also know that <unk> and <unk> mice , infectious to protect .
knew that by our grandmothers also been the us with <unk> and so on <unk> have .

multiple research has really , that dark chocolate , dementia <unk> do it .
just recently is a study <unk> , that has shown that <unk> half the board of dark chocolate , a day , the <unk> one <unk> on the level of <unk> bring it .
like suspected that you of coffee is the <unk> but it thinner .
there 's trials , the show , there 's trials , the that does n't show .
what it 's is that coffee , diabetes <unk> does , and so their metabolic performance better .
and a coffee is the way , a good <unk> because he solves <unk> , how we share with <unk> <unk> from paris to show you could .
<unk> very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people to for they were have shown that people , that every day <unk> handful of nuts to eat their <unk> to 20 percent mortality down .
this is a huge value for <unk> <unk> study .
and this is true of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not to peanuts and the <unk> seen , beans .
the give just , by showing you 're nuts call , okay ?
this is , but actually beans .
so for the peanuts is n't that .
the next thing is a little <unk> .
and avoid them the shot from a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only , if you between <unk> and <unk> years old are .
<unk> very beautiful new study shows is , they , if you in this <unk> to a lot of animal protein to to take you <unk> so strong that , as if you a strong smokers be .
this is not for the time after , where the animal protein good and it is true of course not for <unk> children or a juvenile , the animal protein need and it 's not for pregnant and this , it will want .
in general do you <unk> .
what , and they do , to remain they <unk> that you know , friedrich nietzsche along , the has said , the to , the <unk> , that <unk> mistrust and the <unk> are signs of the health .
all <unk> heard in the pathology lab .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about after that regime , lived and he 's <unk> years old become .
he comes from my home <unk> of the <unk> , is never get sick to become .
and he 's a 's very good .
he 's just not <unk> <unk> not an anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it 's one of healthy <unk> there .
he has about the <unk> followed , that i do you today i 've said .
we should look at all the <unk> experiments <unk> important fact , not only overlook .
which is that this <unk> of <unk> me in a biological but a social seems to be , and so eventually a <unk> .
you <unk> the old people less to and that could of the <unk> mistake of our culture be .
<unk> wrote the one roman the <unk> a year ago , his death .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece , the contemporary critic , the adolescents and fresh <unk> .
i thank you for listening .
i want to begin with a question , that i do you place .
a question , where now no one up to , because that 's a bit of avalokitesvara , who of them is lonely ?
the <unk> 's very low .
less , when i thought .

many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
this is that does not the case .
you 'll see from loneliness is actually more like a phenomenon of people as alone .
maybe it 's because it , it , that they 're not reported that have , because the question , fuzzy put it .
you feel you , lonely , or is you are lonely place ?
you can , lonely , feeling , lonely .
and you are lonely be no , in the moment lonely having to feel .
loneliness that 's too much to shame , to do .
and this is some now here from have , to loneliness to <unk> .
loneliness is in a shame and shame that leads in loneliness .
loneliness that takes time .
it 's why is going to now here 's not reported that have in the few seconds , which i do you gave you have .
one needs <unk> .
loneliness to the time to , of all aware to be .
and loneliness is also practice , to talk about being able to .
and this exercise have that we all do n't .
we have neither the language , we have any sign for us to myself to recognize when we are lonely place ?
there 's the loneliness to two <unk> , which i again and in am .
the one part of humanity 's said , you is from beginning of lonely .
of the birth to death is you actually just a lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go and often to <unk> and drive to the whole day .
i do n't have time , is so you <unk> .
and then have people might be less <unk> say , all , is with everything connected .
that i there 's actually not , so , i is just a part of the big universe .
and there 's the big group , to the i also am the time , so , let 's so thinking .
the thinking , okay , today , i 'm lonely and the next day , oh , it depends , all together .
if we of loneliness to think of us the first of the very large loneliness is a a .
the loneliness of dying , the loneliness to the sick in intensive care .
but over these <unk> , about these big <unk> <unk> ' what i do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , over the mundane <unk> , where loneliness to us , in this is a theater to meet it .
i want to also do n't talk about the burden , and <unk> of <unk> .
loneliness to others to think of us , not hard loneliness to us to <unk> already .
the photographer christine tailors , in the break a few pictures made , that i show you want .
how easy it 's always falls , in other loneliness to .
and we know all not , whether these people really in this moment lonely , have felt .
but who 's n't it , the moment on this <unk> event where you think , all talk together , just you yourself is something lost in the corner and has anybody to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know the safe here all .
may have some of you today , you 've seen .
what you about it does it is the phone out very often , that could you today , very good at this is <unk> , that <unk> on the phone , an escape , the <unk> .
and visible , if you on the display , you look .
what we now here 's not do .
yes , and there 's the loneliness , the degrees of them is the loneliness to a <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces of years ago , and you even something out in the hope , that you to their text , not forget .
these are the <unk> , that you from the outside can see .
that we other people attach .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room , the , from birth of lonely , feeling of all their lives for that i spent have , by showing you have tried , and loneliness of the <unk> , to distract them .
and there in this room , guaranteed , people the lonely , are , because they 're on a different people up to be it because of death or because of separation .
there 's using it 's nothing , that , so many people , people , where they 're connected to around them are you feel the lonely .
and there 's people , the have the to , even lost , no contact with more to , and are so lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit down , you to the fairly analog loneliness .
the analog loneliness is we 're familiar .
that people who , they think it 's no , social contact .
and that 's always be relatively .
there 's not an official number , no <unk> number , whenever somebody to human contact has , when did n't .
we cut down there to the old people .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities to be connected with very many people at facebook or by twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness and bigger and become .
you can do with hundreds of people connected to be , with one of people really connected to be .
it 's at the analog loneliness to the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often the other <unk> .
this is also it , that the analog loneliness a little <unk> <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness is good works for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's kind of go to the digital loneliness in the future , gain is when the possibilities , is to connect , bigger .
i do n't know if you in 20 years that feeling that the our from loneliness is very similar to be going , loneliness to call it .
or whether you this , and then a new word there .
but that are also some sort of problems of the <unk> generation .
almost more than the loneliness to itself is the fear in front of loneliness and from this fear in front of loneliness that are people a lot to do .
<unk> , the big <unk> , as a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in which describes it , what people do everything that 's not just to be .
they build cathedrals , they were witnesses kids , then again , lonely , are and alone .
but that <unk> has n't you named the fear in front of loneliness to figure out , which money to spend .
<unk> go .
things to acquire skills .
well as the process over , the loneliness that , because it at least in the short , in order , the objects themselves , that you acquired .
the problem is just that 's very quickly going to help and holding , this kind of those potions against the loneliness .
so we have to again and new things to buy us to <unk> .
i , the ads for a a <unk> panties label seen .
and the <unk> , very , <unk> of phone to communicate with the slogan n't be a <unk> of it .
what that at the panties , to do n't have , you know you do n't , but it works , that .
loneliness that 's so nothing to the <unk> to do loneliness find under the people that instead .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem written , and there is a verse , the worst is the loneliness to <unk> .
hand on a 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship up or the or the other , <unk> to watch and , suddenly , terrible , just to feel , terrible lonely having to feel and the question to ask , who is this person actually ?
i ' i do with the do something to do ?
a study of saying that the <unk> women around the its , married , with kids , feel .
of missing , because i now , not know , if i the study , even invented to have so often i ' i told .
but it 's also now , whatever it at least in studies , whatever is , and the reaction , the same is that people , i <unk> .
that intuitive way that completely obvious is , almost never been a <unk> .
loneliness to <unk> is anyone familiar and yet to talk , we 're not about them .
so that little bit of loneliness to sex .
and that 's probably already all experienced .
so , while you <unk> is , suddenly appeared to think , what do , here i really ?
who is that person in my bed , really ?
and that a form of loneliness that not really do what must have with the quality of sexual way .
and nothing to do have to the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we do n't you look .
we speak only are not about it in the workforce .
in the workforce is the loneliness and <unk> when we think .
i stood <unk> on this <unk> <unk> and i was a group of five <unk> , better , three carried suit and two carried costume either .
the two men have to talk , the two women in a costume -- have to talk .
and in the state something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in the hand , the <unk> .
i think , i have to you the scene n't need to do so you this shape of loneliness that everyone 's also have time in the workforce has experienced , again <unk> can .
it 's the loneliness the <unk> .
it 's , but also the loneliness the <unk> .
we 've all the <unk> or i see , sit here might also some of their lives <unk> to <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> in the hotels , in <unk> bars that often , not know , who they actually are , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
and that 's a form of loneliness , about the not talking about it .
just so it 's also <unk> , and loneliness than <unk> abused , can be .
down here is insulation .
i have a <unk> told , that he called by a client , and the has said , it 's what , then happened , you can do it you do n't imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so he 's , even for <unk> would .
and two months later he 's also stepped .
the loneliness is n't alone so .
it 's always in the connection with other feelings .
it 's nice siblings and it 's ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings to know , we all .
of being sad and despair , anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful siblings , not forget .
freedom that the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so my plea look at the loneliness to .
come and goes in life as the tide , and floods occur .
let them and let 's not from her up .
because there 's something much worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that perhaps , of loneliness is if you do n't know , there .
one is part of life .
since i was so hard of loneliness thought i have to have , for me two things change .
for a in my <unk> the <unk> i 'm not even more like a <unk> dictator since i realized i realized that i only then , someone called 've why he is not raise because i thought i 've maybe i 'm losing i the people , maybe i 'll ' i lonely .
let me , it 's been able , since i think of loneliness in my life accepted have people come and go to make .
that is it with the <unk> that it does .
also because i was free become .
people come and go to make , they 're not anymore , right to <unk> , whether , from an encounter a friendship , or even a partnership to could .
as a child i found my parents an embarrassing .
the able to do n't <unk> go by without with somebody a conversation begin .
if the <unk> or in the economy .
every time led it to an unending conversations .
as a child i found that as i embarrassed .
as young adult , i do you just for <unk> that to this openness .
but first since i even so with the loneliness too have , that 's me at least , and again , i also <unk> so to open .
you see that 's and lonely , which means to be willing to do for the performance .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i here three seem that .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now that , i mean , if you just once access i which <unk> would you take ?
the most people would , for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we 're going to the least effort , the biggest effect of getting .
in health , we do this kind of different .
there , let the activity with the biggest effect , except for eight and make us for other strategy .
we choose to us for example for the <unk> and the is for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we choose to us for the <unk> .
the is for diet .
also very large <unk> but still very big effort .
for me so , not so valuable .
and i want you today about how you with the least effort , the biggest <unk> do .
if you with the prevention and health , too , is where you to a topic , not a drum around .
and this topic is overweight .
and this issue of obesity , was in germany as long time , no issue , so , until the <unk> .
and then went into the number overweight , in germany , in .
and i asked me , what was there on in the <unk> ?
why did that <unk> suddenly , up ?
and then i did research and i 'm also <unk> become .
because it was exactly the years <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> to germany .
and we 're going over and thicker ?
and i keep on .
<unk> comes <unk> to germany .
and that obesity , up .
and in <unk> take the curve , let 's right at the journey on .
and what 's then , germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how it means .
and we 're over and thicker ?
well , then i was one , and one <unk> .
because it , right .
sports is thick .
and of course <unk> ' what i 'm not here , to tell you , sports and dick 's doing .
because that 's not true .
but one , we 've now i 'd found .
the flood of the new training -- and <unk> n't have to lead , that we <unk> and healthier .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and there 's <unk> very good study from the united states .
also have the problem with obesity .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted you just after that look , what happened there are really ?
and they 've seen , the people 's actually , less fat on , but the people take , and fewer calories to be but nevertheless , thicker bit .
and this was paradox .
and so you have it <unk> called .
we can you explain why ?
there are you to the body as a power station imagine .
because we have here so <unk> big <unk> .
and on the one side is a <unk> , because i do we all the <unk> on to be here is burned .
and here is the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , but more <unk> here in there in our power than we on the other use <unk> , the energy in the power and it does <unk> .
the human body does n't in <unk> .
the can the energy to store .
and it in the form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , but if we are fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> , here the energy , then it 's only one thing to .
the <unk> has to dramatically reduce .
here 's do n't live longer than .
we 're yes , just , mobile .
and that is happening .
our grandparents are <unk> , 20 kilometers to walk gone .
and we come today , degrees , on a way to the two miles and the positive estimates .
there 's trials , the report of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> , you still something <unk> with my friend mike tell .
give you my degrees ' the chair ?
mike , come you degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
it 's too shy , he 's not a lot to talk .
and he was in this study in and sitting now here .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , jeans <unk> <unk> and he 's a <unk> in the hand .
and mike , eats , less and fewer and takes only <unk> , and yet it 's over and thicker bit .
why ?
because that mike 's still sitting .
and i just watched , how much of movement , mike 's a day , and i told him , so one step counter the back in the bag into and the evening i went back <unk> .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
this was so the distance , that mike at has the morning , from the kitchen to the car with the car into the office there course of a coffee up and night , back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
that means that mike , was at that day , 10 minutes on his legs .
<unk> hours and its minutes , i was mike , or was mike .
under those conditions of disease of alone .
and mike 's not so , dick , because it to be much eating , because so long it up again and energy <unk> this , but not used he will inevitably the thicker , and the energy <unk> .
and the first <unk> , the energy , you see here , his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , that 's not there .
the <unk> , eventually , back in <unk> blood .
and also because it 's active and <unk> still , and quiet on his <unk> .
so the blood sugar .
so when the energy <unk> the blood , to talk about the doctors of high blood sugar and high <unk> .
and this blood sugar , the <unk> 's like <unk> , does all the little holes in this <unk> .
and a very lucky , floating in there , the fat around and that <unk> , well over these little wounds and we speak of <unk> or <unk> .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now to it 's blood flowing through these tight <unk> pots pumps and we talk from high .
and if this high , then on this is a <unk> is , it 's also in the body <unk> .
and if the heart is what happens then we call the heart attack .
and if that in mind that happens then we call the stroke .
and also in germany , and dies every second of heart , stroke .
that means in germany dies every second , <unk> .
and also mike gets so not so sick because it any exercise is driving it because it to do n't even more moved .
and if you that what do n't know , for you always in the wrong .
so for the subject of diet .
i have degrees ' yesterday , a diet in the amazon , into and there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , now .
and if each book , just like an inch , dick 's and we were going to the here <unk> , we have a 30 feet high tower current <unk> <unk> .
and i got the time for you all read .
and there 's inside and this is now , really important if you more energy in so more food as they consume and then you be thick .
and if you less energy that when they consume and then you be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to <unk> books ?
that 's just a conclusion .
that need of course , is huge , but <unk> is to do n't help .
because why have failure a diet to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and not a lifestyle .
what 're using the things that , that we here 's for three weeks going to do and here 's five weeks ago when we then , after this struggle , again in the normal life back , to our ordinary life .
what we then , after five or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .
except <unk> and again a <unk> in the confidence that we again , not that made , what we 're going on have .
so to them . ab now at any new diet , at any new <unk> questions , and you like this in their day-to-day , in your lifestyle , into .
yes or no ?
and when i mean , then go .
and if no , you make it just stay .
because if the end n't come out , it 's pure time .
it is the habits of about to decide whether we 're sick , or a healthy .
it 's the bad habits , that 's ill do .
and it 's the good behavior of us healthy , do .
and if mike , in the mirror at then you see it 's the result of everyday lifestyle .
if mike in the looking at , then see it 's your everyday habits .
and if mike , in the mirror at and frankly , to , is , you see it also , where he way .
because when he 's more bad habits , as good , then he 's just in the disease , the way .
and if mike in the way to toward health direction of its goals , kind of its dreams , does n't he immediately be whole life change .
then we need it just enjoying more good behavior as bad .
and a , <unk> habits , mike 's also a great example of the person , a weird animal is .
mike 's for example , i did , movement is completely from his life <unk> by it every way to the car , every <unk> uses , every elevator , using .
and night and he <unk> on the couches and to sort of <unk> again to wave comes .
so is it , in his <unk> , the gym where with the <unk> after the top of what is yes , by se , paradox is , and will then how this <unk> rat back on this is a band <unk> , so he somehow got back to movement is coming .
and my grandpa , have to that <unk> as you .
the was a farmer and the have that did n't understand .
the have said , sport is for people that is n't move .
and somehow he 's also , right .
why we have to night in our precious leisure and that to compensate for what we in life <unk> have ?
are taken we have today with this <unk> lifestyle , two hours of sports and make a day .
and about , but very much easier to the movement , there to find where we do you 've lost .
in life .
and so <unk> ' i do you today to a perspective invite you .

and that you look like , programmed into this <unk> in us .
we 're always the shortest because they go .
we 're planning our homes , so that we the <unk> ways .
we 're planning our whole life that we the <unk> ways to have , but that leads us , but not there , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so to you ab now the <unk> activate and the movement , and find , where they degrees up .
i <unk> ' for example , like with the very much .
and i 'm the only , of all up and down and up and down walks and everybody else away .
but if i yet been there 's me then <unk> ' i mean , the time for me .
then <unk> ' i mean , the movement , that 's just like this around is .
and if of the top of <unk> coming , 30 minutes <unk> , say , i <unk> .
<unk> steps .
that 's about three times 10 minutes , translated it .

this may be relatively little sound .
but as <unk> , as a habit established , just <unk> days the year , then we speak of four point five pounds fat .
that we 're not in our bodies have .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> , it always <unk> .
the americans are , crazy , the imagine that here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are think , i had four pounds .
just so you let 's see , what happened there with this little steps .
and if that the effect is from this perspective , what you mean , what 's just happened , if you really in an active life on .
and these <unk> the get them to go from now every day in their day-to-day .
once you in <unk> steps per day , which are going , you virtually all <unk> of them .
and if you then got and i have in sports and then they do that on top .
then you have to the <unk> also , <unk> .
then they will also , and faster and stronger .
but do with them into your health , no more dependent on behalf of sports .
so they make your health , not more dependent on of like , and of their time .
because the most of the most important that they do now , every day as a lifestyle .
and i <unk> , an active lifestyle <unk> .
and to me is it has more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that on a clear that decision based on for the lives and for me to myself .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do , or do have .
but health has to do with , what we do want .
and so <unk> ' what i just an idea for them .
you decide to go from now just , just for best .
and now you know , how it goes .
step .
thank you very much .
<unk> how it has a leonardo da vinci , actually done on this incredible , <unk> way the world with others have to see ?
and yet , so far on the <unk> what to his time just simply unthinkable , never was ?
we could something like today , ?
has that maybe what to <unk> to do ?
and how we can it into force and confidence to our future draw ?
we start yet , there on with the question what do we actually sort of innovation ?
it .
this invention of research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the federal government .
so they get me right .
this is yes , all the great .
and we can with quite proud to be , and be grateful that we <unk> in such a lot of fields are that our <unk> around the world to be that 's good with it goes .
that we do with a this extraordinary , unique , wealth , evolved .
but what it with the future from ?
the challenges , because when society based on us ?
and who care because the large environmental and social challenges ?
so <unk> , it seems that somehow <unk> .
some kind of labor .
so the economy care of the environmental challenges , because the entrepreneurs and a big effort with the we then the productivity and efficiency up .
and the the world better we want to make the finding , in the non-profit organizations and together and <unk> and the need to then , what do so the main thing <unk> course , to then the damage the capitalist in the economy to remove themselves .
at least <unk> to fix it .
but who says because that we all that as such separated at need ?
how about , because if we <unk> to <unk> social and cultural dimension , you ?
if technological innovation , as cultural innovation are ?
if the economic innovations , as social innovation are ?
if it 's <unk> <unk> thinking and doing sent to self-assemble with the solution large environmental and social challenges ?
if it very different in the unknown forces <unk> and if it 's <unk> a very different , fair <unk> development to promote ?
because it was that ?
both sides to but what companies , right ?
can that work ?
so they may come .
so far we have that yes , as a contradiction way .
for happiness , there 's encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus , with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh creepy , much does the poverty , there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more just in direct <unk> to the , what the government <unk> done have .
and he has <unk> as entrepreneurs , i realized that the prize <unk> get .
at the opportunity because of me , i <unk> ' they still with someone how do .
allow , can i think <unk> <unk> .
'n very <unk> young guy .
great trained , has , but also its ideal from .
and yes , so totally <unk> .
i like the really like .
and if you the see , then you think oh really , the offspring , because we need to us to our future , n't worry about doing .
yes , right after the studies have , he then there 's begun to work at one of our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it does he also very good .
that they like him , and there 's also very successful .
and yet , anything is there 's still so in him .
so he asks , there 's not even more , this kind of in me out ?
so that the entrepreneurial , he says , then always .
<unk> are , in all <unk> .
and that they like him too .
and he would like , these <unk> .
so the right there 's also the <unk> , he 's because the same people .
so not that he got it personally , you know , but it comes from <unk> tell him the , what .
and since the in the center at the t three n the knew he does n't .
so , the more , it was surprised when the and then the <unk> personally imagined was .
when mister <unk> .
and as 'n an accomplished who has , he then there imagined .
the 's great pleasure for instance , so with young people together , there , and his experience <unk> .
and the two have then by other , found .
and i 've always more hit .
how about it because if we just so in a bunch of those conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , so how it was because again , right .
what is now , exactly the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> company ?
that i still not so , understood .
yes , so , <unk> then we start , but the time to look at the question what 's 'n <unk> company ?
so the name says , yeah .
established markets , established products , established customers , established structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also quite the projections . there , where to the shapes <unk> .
and time <unk> <unk> <unk> , the very neat is can it also .
what 's because then actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you <unk> , so one is a guaranteed to do it 's just not the small copy of a big company .
it 's something else .
it has yes , a different character .
because it 's <unk> nothing <unk> .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of that 's a <unk> a temporary organization of the purpose is a business to go to find , to develop the profitable is , of course , but , <unk> is , and then the scale it .
and you 're going to be safe to understand , that 's lots of course , so <unk> organization , very different very different ways of thinking there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yes , that 's me , right .
but , what 's supposed to because it really ?
so , i jump ' time , then it goes straight because you can <unk> <unk> to make money right ?
so i there , degrees , that fits very well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin , would you me that would recommend it ?
it means <unk> .
how you your companies to succeed <unk> and after the <unk> your life for <unk> did .
oh no .
really <unk> ?
what you think , because if you with the beginning , 30 to your <unk> money did what 's because after your <unk> ?
so <unk> you a career as passive <unk> or what ?
what happens then with your commitment , as i do you know ?
and let 's yet , the <unk> in .
so the statistics about <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are very few years , then in a much worse financial situation , in your great .
it 's always the result of a successful company , and one good <unk> enterprise .
it , money is an energy source for <unk> <unk> .
and it 's the basis of economic <unk> .
but it 's never the goal of an enterprise .
yes , which is then the goal ?
of the company ?
so , when i do n't pick , i ' yet we learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , really have yet , the way measurable time certainly be , and so forth .
and when i do it 's not have , so that as i can make a search of the i do n't know what i 'm supposed to ?
so that makes me do n't feel good .
so how do i because there are and and actually go into it feels to me anything like you know , and inherently uncertain of .
yes , <unk> welcome the <unk> .
but i there might do for you .
one thread .
so the is yes , <unk> , so almost a secret .
successful <unk> of generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , or how you today ?
<unk> think , i , <unk> ?
so we say <unk> always <unk> to .
and when crises and <unk> and <unk> sustainable uncertainty .
so it guarantees that .
i think , i can you one of leave .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there are , just ask them on it .
that can you through the same time you one of the engage qualities 's good question to imagine .
we can the time one after the other through , that i that perhaps better understand ?
so the first is what i 'm here and what i want you do ?
yes , <unk> , there 's a 's <unk> what moves you that 's about you down , the greater is when you yourself ?
what <unk> you the world ?
what have the people of them , if you with you work ?
what you are willing to do ?
what are your inner , perhaps , yes , unconscious <unk> ?
why is that matters , that to see ?
because that are also your <unk> <unk> .
and how we have that of learned ?
if you a ship to build you want to then <unk> not the men together parts of a hot , you want to wood to collect , but i teach them , desire to the and then , an unending sea .
yes , well .
so then you look , i let me the next questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what is that ?
yes , <unk> now do you your goal really , <unk> .
colorful <unk> in detail , colorful , but i <unk> , you in a if you <unk> , what you do n't want to then it 's going to you , attached to stay .
know you actually the story with the pink and elephants ?
of me , there is a .
not ?
<unk> .
so , watch out time on .
get you , not a pink and elephants ago .
okay ?
it does it 's been doing ?
so no pink and elephants .
did ?
no pink elephants .
you see you ?
so it 's us , if we 're so on to focus on this , what we do n't want .
what is there 's actually the only way ?
because it <unk> ?
yes , right , get , you that , what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the <unk> on the <unk> .
but you get , you <unk> ago .
the way , what i just thing you like , <unk> right ?
i , you a brought .
look , if you the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> war room <unk> lord smith .
who ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a , <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i do <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady smith .
oh , but but <unk> <unk> you <unk> ?
madam as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you one <unk> adversity do <unk> <unk> may is <unk> .

it 's <unk> a , <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
and <unk> what 's from ?
is you what i noticed ?
has to something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower , too .
okay .
so , so let 's time and so let 's where the bear with is .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> war <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a , <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i do <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i do <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady smith .
and <unk> , how it 's telling you ?
so , i know , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i the first time that i ' .
i thought it ca : yes , it was to be .
and still much more in shock , i was as me through the head into is it might be that i really all the time that way through the area over ?
by my life .
and okay , i understand , the power , yes , meaning .
the end up there 's the immediate <unk> to prevent us to the most of our perception and our <unk> first <unk> to .
but what 's because now , on ?
what <unk> ' i was , and what <unk> ' i from ?
and so <unk> , realize you your perception in some place <unk> to , is <unk> more important entrepreneurial quality .
well , thanks , then we come , but the time to the next question .
how could i really want to my goal to come ?
so , that i think <unk> good question .
that that , i which every time , and i know that somehow not go forward .
yes , <unk> , there 's <unk> good news for you .
this is going to you easier to fall when you may have known in .
because if you your what is clear , your inner drive and if you 'n concrete goal , of introduced you have i promise you , it 's inside of their own happen .
almost automatically .
you will not all else can than that a brainstorming , you going on , that stuff on you coming up .
that are then these famous <unk> , that you in the shower , did .
and still <unk> question i recommend that i do you in to look for you very well , to , who you have you could , who you the advice to ask you could to go there more water input , more at with home to get .
and you 've also a model .
the <unk> have the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , if the no more to know , has the in his <unk> invited back in florence .
for lunch at the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , a banker , who were engineers , architects and he has <unk> very intense <unk> clean .
but not in our today 's a sense , where it 's drum , went , who is , through ?
who 's right ?
but rather to that suddenly , these different <unk> things come out of these are the so on no way , and the way that one of themselves have to come to .
well , yes , the next question is the concrete next step i do ?
<unk> there are doing , it 's successful entrepreneur in the reason , very simple .
instead , to and management and so we focus they always just on the next step .
because what should you because in of uncertainty , do ?
but the lead this really determined and with all the consequence of .
and if it 's and then there was well , dan , and they know , <unk> one step .
and even if the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's and you know <unk> other .
so it 's so important that you your what is clear .
that there are you the inside of security .
and the way as we 've actually all have learned ?
although we do that yes n't know , and it , nobody has said ?
-- you think it 's also <unk> at the children .
so , this playful and learning , this for , and this <unk> playful and it 's also , the fun doing that in a company is in a <unk> .
and that 's also what kind of the <unk> against the uncertainty , we would always been so anxious about it .
yes , thank mister <unk> .
so this sounds , it’s already quite nice to .
but i do n't know , at me in the company , i think , there must , still a lot of bosses change that there anything happens .
and myself so here in germany , there 's always been so these general mood .
and i think , there have to the politicians first to worry , that is changing .
okay , my boy , come on time with .
how do here 's go down the water .
what you think , many people can you change ?
10 ?
tens of ?
ten million ?
look , here , down .
who see that you ?
right , the .
this is the you change can , you really change can .
or to it , mahatma gandhi to say , looking for the change , that you in the world , looking in you yourself .
you think it 's safe , beautiful words and big models , but how do that because it work ?
because we have to happiness , 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all <unk> of crises , or if you to it feel for something or if you a <unk> <unk> and you 've all with you to do .
and if you 're in such when you ask what you make you now despite this <unk> , you that stance , you take you can physically came to make you powerful to feel .
that , you , but the time , what you to <unk> like , the you 're <unk> .
and all the end , that , you , what you actually from this crisis , or the , what 's bad happened is because it .
so i my , if it frightens you already happening is that it 's at least was totally worth it .
yeah well .
mister <unk> thank you .
and you think really want to me that helps them on my <unk> way ?
yes , right .
and realize you , two things .
first time in eighth place on the clarity of your inner <unk> , then to your <unk> what will .
because it determines your perception .
and the second eighth place on your inner attitude to you yourself , .
because it <unk> you like the other people , you to behave .
the future of the only then when we have our own perception of change .
<unk> you have this ?
yes , i think , already .
thank mister <unk> well then .
all good andré <unk> .
yes .
what you think of our <unk> ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how would think we , because now , with this <unk> ?
it 's a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
so very clear .
which i , the <unk> see .
<unk> is to breathe <unk> .
and this is , what the <unk> really is .
a <unk> from potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
that is something of <unk> .
the right now country , long way in the big famous name <unk> .
by robert bosch , over <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or how they all the hot .
let us , just those minds to animate .
and who knows that might be yes , from our <unk> the next leonardo of our time .
you see the right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so <unk> to me with kids and their future 'm because finally , are , kids in our future .
instead is that the view , i the most of time i enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , have my father and i the program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , who started .
we could qualify <unk> entrepreneurial , that means you can , after the custody , either on making or find after their <unk> lighter one of the workplace , they then also keep you can .
why <unk> i now , so all the <unk> , so the ones that have failed are the big mistake i 've done ?
our program is much not so easy to understand how programs that , the kids do .
and frankly , i said , i thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , in which i work would .
what you think , is the most missing a factor in the up with the people with that we work ?
we 've found , it are positive models often the male , positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> there are often is it on the father 's no sensible work has that he <unk> , that he drugs and consumed or that it ourselves in prison is .
and if then a <unk> young think about what it from his life to make he 's perhaps no better idea , as a different lives might look , because it 's no better models .
and he <unk> his father , .
i <unk> , you , martin , imagine .
martin 's <unk> our program .
his father was an alcoholic and made the whole family that live in the hell .
when he 12 was is his mother died , and he and be smaller brother had to go home .
and he was the <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> , and so the perfect victims .
to the day as being a brother , in a game so roughly <unk> been is that the ground that stayed .
there transformers , martin the first time the <unk> through , he went on the other off and proposed to .
and this day he was respect .
and so it was going on .
violence was from now to his life , just like in his father .
how it goes well at the ones , that i just described have , on ?
after the childhood , of adolescence are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you 've not much different than your illegal activities and their <unk> <unk> .
and then you be one day with people in jail locked in which it that goes , their thoughts about the same thing around the , no better models are .
about what , you think , think these people together , if you put together in prison are ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're getting better and criminals and in <unk> .
they sell a drug on a higher level and plan , in custody , where they 're going to the custody <unk> could .
and that then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
that means , in germany will everybody had two , criminals and go back .
then there , but also people in prison that really change want .
but also these people wear a <unk> on the forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that their first identity .
if you a work for , if you an apartment for , if you a private relationships to want to go anywhere you be with this identity , with this <unk> face , you a who in the society that infinite hard power .
this is the problem , in the we 're on .
how we try , this problem to solve ?
what property , you think , put a lot <unk> with ?
they would be surprised .
it 's the entrepreneurial skills .
who 's a <unk> been building has 's definitely know of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only the subject <unk> has a 's a little <unk> , anything about , he 's not in prison landed .
these characteristics we would like to for something positive use .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three <unk> .
we give the basics of entrepreneurship and the economy .
everyone to write its own <unk> and everybody who takes , getting <unk> part .
and then with we the people , after the custody at the <unk> , at the <unk> at the <unk> your personal relations and also at one of <unk> .
what to <unk> go there from our program , ?
it 's a range , the <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .
a range and to <unk> ' i do you 'd like <unk> imagine .
<unk> leaders talent and his illusion of the rapid money you 've got it 's very early , for trade with the cocaine seduced .
he had always been fun it , businesses to do .
he 's then <unk> the first time arrested , has been .
and this into custody , it 's not very impressed me .
it in the opposite .
he says -- now , he would have at its second custody for me .
<unk> is he then the second time in the .
he took the only on a therapy part and then the <unk> .
and i learned when he 'd like he leaders talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september 13 had been , then october <unk> and agency for <unk> started .
the agency 's how well , he can now of life .
he has a very good <unk> out .
he is today with me here .
who him to know to talk about it in .
still time back to martin , of the i 'm going to him at how did .
martin 's got to his childhood a training to the chef <unk> and ended up in his time in the <unk> <unk> .
and alcohol , and drugs , there at the agenda are was being you very quickly started .
he was working with a dj , and as <unk> .
twenty years , which he took this life .
and he says , that he was with this lifestyle to do n't own consciousness <unk> has .
one day injured , he did anyone in a <unk> so hard that he then i was convicted by .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there 's really be life changed .
he learned , he wants to more force to more success and to more lives are able without its <unk> to strive for or without drugs to consume .
and he was kind of your knowledge and so thrilled that he decided they had this to he would pass .
and he wanted part of <unk> to .
that has <unk> .
he 's now been thinking about two years at us and <unk> our participants in their way in the freedom , because he knows ourselves that , if you , really change to conclude , and if you the right tools to look at the hand , you get that much more possible is when you often i want .
the basis of these successes are the way people as you .
people , the with us in jail on the to external events to come from us , to our participants in their <unk> , in your personal plans to which .
this is our <unk> , the <unk> talks in our class now , this is students at the <unk> do , <unk> the <unk> do .
and that 's our mentors , that our participants right after the prison with .
and these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we do on our events such an exercise , the . <unk> call them .
we 're pasting , then in the middle of space is a big <unk> our participants are on the one and our an stand on the other .
and i 'm then of questions .
and every time , if someone in space that question , yes answer is it at the line .
and here is , what we all common , whether we within the prison sit or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of this , where the differences are , is the following question .
i 'm in a call social focal up , i had a family member of what we 've even in custody .
there are usually a lot of our participants in front of the line , and just very few of an .
a question , i 'd like for us , all together , the <unk> ' i 'd like you imagine .
so please , i do you that they all even get up .
maybe we a little light get the audience .
i can see them .
it are all .
well .
thank you .
i get , you now a question , and if you that question , yes to answer to put them . back to , otherwise would remain they just stand .
that 's kind of our our line , we now to move .
i have in my life of things done , for the i was punished be able to it was , but not .
if you that question with right answer put them , please .
that counts , drunk car went to be .
that counts , maybe too low doses of <unk> obsessed .
that counts , it with the seat , not just taken to have .
okay .
and it 's also to , perhaps , any workforce , not always very correctly for .
all right .
the most of your seats .
we have a few angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , you get , all over again sit down .
in this question , if we the on the events , imagine , get our an very often to me .
and you will also clear , how much greater happiness , you may have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment in the they were growing up , with the friends but also very fortunate that , they may not going to get caught been are if you something on the edge of <unk> or even about it out to do .
what 's the result of our work ?
<unk> percent of our alumni , from within <unk> days after their <unk> a work .
this is rapidly as quickly .
<unk> percent of this is already on .
a third of the donors are in the last year they were <unk> .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i did it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , <unk> percent to .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year , the base thirty thousand dollars .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> , what a <unk> of seven percent , a <unk> of typically <unk> percent of a <unk> means .
when my father and i put together in the <unk> started to have , we 're open , stood up from pretty much for quite nuts , that i had been .
i was my great <unk> in a big businesses , given up .
but i want to tell you , i in my life , not as a <unk> work done .
we encourage our participants this , responsibility to take over .
responsibility , in your life has happened , and , responsibility for to take , in their lives will happen .
, not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a whole new self confidence and gives it , toward this again , trust you .
and so it makes me very happy and pride , when our participants , frankly , of their way to report .
here , i did you a little video to bring .
film .
so i was convicted to two years , and eight months , because of dangerous <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months , convicted .
i have to <unk> acted .
so , i judgment of two years getting about dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> has to actually my complete life changed .
and what to me , it was , was this <unk> , the also done is .
because there was my , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , <unk> ' i almost to say , yeah .
i went back goals , and <unk> .
i got back into perspective of i went back to go forward at .
and you go with a very different awareness and confidence from the custody out .
so far it was always more <unk> n't fixed these goals and then is you hold in and anything <unk> .
with the wrong people together and this now , not anymore .
well , the problem is , many no <unk> have , if the out .
that the biggest problem , because it 's automatically which is , you back in the old <unk> coming .
you know , nothing else .
by this <unk> individual <unk> , whatever , what 's all being offered is , at me just my whole mindset of me ask yourself , about other , about -- with problems , about -- with the society , this at me just as these two weeks , completely around .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman who get .
and since <unk> six months <unk> ' i went back with her together .
that is so , we have a new relationship started .
and because i under one , through this whole <unk> and many other things change i ' .
so much i ' i 've achieved .
i 'm with my family back in pure that education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , <unk> ' i say .
i do , just a <unk> to <unk> .
you have to that actually acknowledge that it , very many people are the fact , for example , my mentor , now , about this time , out and actually about to be yes , i do n't know <unk> engagement , beyond the people to support .
i 'm grateful for this is , they the idea at all come are , that they 're so what do .
i 'm grateful for this is , they it , with safety of trouble <unk> have and i 'm extremely grateful , that i was part of his having me .
that are one of course , the people to support , and were .
i like i said , many people in the events was talking , and the me again and confirmed have this is good , that , ' .
and that 's going ' i 's also do .
and say , i thank you .
they come with us in jail .
each of you have something that we need to .
if you our participants in their <unk> which , whether it as the <unk> to come from us whether it in the frame of a financial support that are .
if you our program in a new <unk> who want , <unk> issue .
we talk about it tells us , please , .
martin <unk> and i are here today .
and forward to us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i 've done in <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time in the time i do a way .
there do you know these things .
, for <unk> for .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in a convent .
it 's right now actually many ways as you with dissatisfaction deal can .
more specifically as you dissatisfaction deal can .
anyway , i was <unk> also the way .
with my work and so 'n bit with the <unk> .
which i 'm here 's really <unk> talk to .
and not from the real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and i could tell me , quite right <unk> like my life in 10 two decades , 30 years look like this is .
it was <unk> .
and these <unk> i found scary .
the least to express .
in which i had an <unk> <unk> crisis .
for as private .
i knew just not to the <unk> way to go ?
do it 's me just comfortable ?
or what if i mean <unk> again , throw ?
and look , then what happens .
what then on me wait .
that were so the idea .
i was in this time , free <unk> at a day .
so as i <unk> .
the <unk> was for me , despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you <unk> free the world lives in very good hotels and <unk> this country in a <unk> way , and the way .
<unk> but <unk> also very <unk> countries .
the developing world where it certainly more to see , and say , there than about <unk> villages to kind <unk> people that , though they do n't have , for happiness and joy <unk> .
right of these images and from cliché and live , but a <unk> way too .
and that was for me , a while the key .
i was that what i did to little .
the surface .
and i found it 's a little <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i really do n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries , right <unk> .
the <unk> was writing to .
and to my personal interest to be breastfeeding .
how to learn to countries are better know ?
by showing you with the people who lives .
at the people living , on you home .
not in the hotel .
by showing you , with the challenges and with the problems of people engaged .
and by showing you with the people who works .
at least was that the answer , that i wanted to that question to give you could .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something meaningful to do .
i wanted a contribution to afford .
to do good .
and this sense of has , at me , especially in a <unk> still further of .
i was it before , often in developing world , nepal 's got me just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was there 's a <unk> civil war , not only one of orphans , but also many economic and social problems left .
with an annual income of <unk> dollars is nepal , the poorest country in south asia .
and counting to continue to the two decades of the poorest countries , the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population has to malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult can not reading and writing .
all these facts are connected with very many personal stories and experiences that i on this journey had met on me in a time , i was willing and frankly , was to change .
in the time i even a change wanted .
and drum up after my return out of nepal my decision that .
i quit my job .
and <unk> me at the aid .
and i <unk> ' now , just an excerpt of the answer <unk> the , i mean application received .
because they just a <unk> was .
it 's going to a serious application in <unk> international <unk> company .
and not to a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> that you know it 's in nepal 's life , i want , and a funding of your <unk> for .
hi ?
it 's still ?
my application was really seriously mean , and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really down .
and i ' course , right away a very emotional response is written .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
instead , i ' i do this , right at the sense of taken to what good <unk> to do .
i used as an engine , my own business to the reasons .
<unk> .
heart <unk> and soul <unk> .
a company that basically just that provides what then i looked for have .
which is the way , a country unlike to traveling .
the way of a country gets really know .
and i do with the people , in life and work .
and it 's not anywhere on it , but in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in two words into .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means much , as a place at the you good karma collect it .
at the you good can do .
it sounds so 'n little bit <unk> .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use tourism as a tool for sustainable development .
or we 're using <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people with us to do while your <unk> useful volunteering .
they pay for their journey , in a different organizers .
but they travel , just a different .
they live in <unk> .
and the objective is not as a lot of recovery or as much <unk> but the real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
to engage . our participants , ever , qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work , <unk> tourism , in areas and the otherwise , no chance on the classic tourism have .
because just the necessary in infrastructure that 's missing .
for others can we sustainable projects will increase .
we can own sustainable projects <unk> and finance .
we pay for us so to a hundred percent of ourselves .
are also not on to depend .
and this is us just for our long term residential development engagement of meaning .
now we have to our work <unk> in nepal .
<unk> year we have our engagement in uganda <unk> .
and so after about four years turned to us now i 've got married , and my husband and i are also for a team of <unk> question .
let 's the <unk> gone further ?
or what if we still get to think ?
if we the <unk> still going on this ?
if we do with this is not just a social engagement and sustainable travel to my but the development in the wholeness it ?
and so , the individual <unk> have ?
or , specialty individual <unk> .
that would then in basically a new an extra company .
a business , that , company into .
with other <unk> but the same philosophy , like <unk> .
we want to this ?
i was the next question .
'n new business ?
sure we want to this .
we love , entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we 're going to <unk> .
because we the same language to talk .
because we the same dreams dreams .
because we the challenges to understand .
and so we have in this year <unk> one sister , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> and we 're creative companies in your development and <unk> <unk> that we go through in the people to support .
this with we the participants , entrepreneur , or some collaborators from the creative companies with individual development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> other side of <unk> contain .
and <unk> the on the <unk> prepare .
the there 's at <unk> , again .
a bunch of the next to a meaningful <unk> , one more huge advantage .
he shows a in relatively short time on where you is , or where you <unk> .
where you may still <unk> prejudice , did .
where you might want to bit more flexible , is , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a on , at , you really good is .
is a its strength of eyes .
that 's the creativity , the sudden , great .
or is it of serenity that you to in the discovered .
of serenity and things to embrace that you would n't you can change .
and the force , things to change , that you can change .
and you can very much change .
already in very short time .
we know this .
one of this .
that <unk> rose <unk> , lydia . and <unk> .
that are five very wonderful women in uganda .
with a sad <unk> and with a talent .
they would be beautiful , <unk> <unk> for years .
and for years happened nothing .
because they simply no market for it had .
because they did n't know , as you the quality can improve .
because you nobody has said , what design may be in question is coming .
we wanted to these women help .
and so in this year , a <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products of the people out of poverty get .
that you a income there .
a future to .
we 're yesterday with our <unk> live gone .
and we start with a first <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> of thousands <unk> of our women .
the sale to you 're not just for a year , income .
but allows us as well , this project , much larger to do .
this first <unk> 's sort of social crowd <unk> and <unk> in a .
so who help to be this , with the purchase a chain do to the other he can , but with us , directly into the project to travel .
he can be able to the women go and to actively <unk> .
the long we want to do n't just five women a job there , but its or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but in nepal and in other <unk> , in which we <unk> work .
this is , but this <unk> just a project from our integrated the cycle of projects .
we 're working in all the central areas .
in <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in the only one area easy to little bit .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have in this year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre , who started .
everything we 're in our own cycle in .
and the power , more sense , as each one project for .
in place where we 've ever , qualification into the various projects .
the of ways to , then , just in the common work .
and to closing , i want to you now , right on a journey to take .
and please , i do you the eyes to close .
imagine , you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a wooden dining room .
and you are satisfied and tired of .
you 've just with your <unk> to lunch eaten .
there 's <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
in here 's pleasant warm .
you <unk> out of the window .
and see kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet <unk> the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
also on them is a thin layer <unk> dust .
the kids were laughing .
and calls for fun to your name .
you <unk> you that they will not just <unk> call .
<unk> .
you know , not , as late , it 's .
but soon , you going to get up .
and the <unk> , on the 's still the kids were , <unk> .
the end of the street is a tree .
here you going to you with lydia 's .
in the meadow sitting in the shadows of the tree you the new designs of <unk> discuss .
like , you with my hands and feet to talk .
later come in the other women this .
they smile , you <unk> in .
until you with your english <unk> .
the tree .

and that it 's still the internet , there .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .

the exchange is every time value .
and it 's beautiful time again , german to talk .
you <unk> music .
and that <unk> of <unk> .
mom <unk> washing the courtyard , the pots .
she sings , an african song .
you are relaxed , and happy .
you the eyes back to do .
each of us can the <unk> to meet , on something new <unk> .
or at least for a short time that cube again news to throw .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i start , to me interested , whether of you today , tonight , that they 're here , the time someone 'n ' house that .
i <unk> , with the light does n't really well , but maybe to , someone came up .
down here <unk> ' i find someone .
two .
here , up <unk> ' i 'm not , but , down here are been two , that 's nice , we 've been to <unk> .
i did , which is also a building occupied and the ones villa mountain in the east of the city <unk> .
this is the building .
together with two other people have ' i the villa out in the last summer , six months for that .
and so <unk> ' what i tonight , here , you .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
so what 's also ?
<unk> there 's , yes , many .
but i want to make it quickly explain .
oh , what , you occupied by now the villa out ?
and you <unk> then the park or how ?
just , a variety of questions that as we know , friends , colleagues have asked when you have experienced , i part of an initiative with which i <unk> ' to , something <unk> name , <unk> am .
all expected , that we transition in the series of <unk> <unk> had .
and this around these villa <unk> you had , <unk> <unk> and the banner put up did .
and in order to the privatization of these villa to protesting .
but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , the you privately is , and so for many people do n't available to it says , <unk> ' i do n't say , but i just not in public hand is , and why not so be used to be , how to public spaces may use .
we were a group of <unk> together in the desire to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable to deal .
and we wanted a different <unk> tell .
we were a <unk> team and that i must now very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
of course , also with different social cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives <unk> and <unk> .
and have allowed us , in different skills but also in various networks <unk> .
and creative part unconventional solutions in the <unk> , then we did , <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated , the villa out to occupy .
however , about it 's about that we all of a villa with stories and ideas to occupy .
we have to memories and i 'm asking .
and from those memories and images out to try , of perspective for the villa out to develop .
and it 's important that the process and more constructive remains .
us as an initiative , we have this has always as <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .
so i was <unk> a <unk> and emotional occupy and was , and after to a <unk> .
on the experiences , that we and have made , <unk> ' what i tonight go .
every city has <unk> places .
the one neighborhood , a face there .
in many cases , this , <unk> and <unk> and be in the result of citizens , strangers are places seen .
they are the dead -- a city because you just a lot not the equivalent to , what we in a public space expect .
so for example that we <unk> have , <unk> have .
are these , but also the fact , public , the urban places we neglected , this is often <unk> .
initiatives , that these places back to want to stay in many , <unk> interest , in the infancy , put them .
what 's also with me to do , like it 's some questions , like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places to give our town , not just a face .
no .
they are the social those of the city , in the our social life is happening .
so with each we went there are often the first <unk> actually to our neighbors , if we 're looking at random on the way to shop to meet .
and so this increase , if we just a <unk> have , to sit , and we actually stop , if the spaces , this designed .
and we just 'n longer <unk> .
it to form friendships , sometimes .
but what with security , it 's a sense of community .
ever more , who i and in this is a public space , i ' <unk> faster and <unk> like , it 's also this community .
and when i do n't <unk> , which is just that , what you think of anonymity is a big city called .
we were then , two challenges .
we can look at the citizens , consciousness , responsibility and engagement for your neighborhood up or in <unk> also <unk> be .
how can protest in the creation be transformed them ?
how can only criticism in the ideas to be transformed them ?
a protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism , the growing and actually also not , which <unk> of the same places .
so they 're now , that they sit here , again , they beat the newspaper on and read the following the text .
i love <unk> and citizens , we invite you , we want you three things varieties of the <unk> of <unk> imagine that a before carefully <unk> <unk> designed .
you get the boat in the idea of a nuance choose .
and the alternative to the most <unk> is then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone of them to this event , go ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it does n't let 's great .
there 's <unk> way , what <unk> .
you can <unk> , like this in the future that looks .
and , it sounds , first time and the first moment .
i trial , me , yet , an explanation .
and it , because i the opinion , you ca n't really to join or pick up or <unk> , <unk> .
one , because the classic <unk> a lot to be late <unk> .
that means , mostly they have no opportunity , really own them to make or some alternatives to discuss , but there 's actually been <unk> design and you can <unk> , decide , if you <unk> or <unk> in the urban green plants .
or , like a friend of other day said , what color the trash can have for example .
second one explanation for the classic <unk> is rarely spoke about information and vote out .
you think of the three <unk> varieties .
we have here is that we want to show you and they must then we vote .
frustration and , incomprehension -- are often the following what i also kind of which is .
i certainly have to any decision about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i actually rather ai <unk> way where instead <unk> <unk> had had .
it goes , but also different .
although we the <unk> the existing <unk> a lot of talking about , we have ultimately a lot <unk> experience .
so we have experience up and that i want to try to others <unk> share .
i want it pass on others have initiatives , in other projects , but also , or , especially in the city and at the policy .
because of the ones that are , the like <unk> actually able to and the most responsible for these kinds of processes are .
if there is really the interest of what is that so often <unk> and let 's going to then we need and then we need the who new <unk> .
ca n't last <unk> ' i but also to you all , that you today , sit here .
and it 's why , because i <unk> for very important is .
i <unk> , it for most important that they all go , and i want to them with our example , encourage , the <unk> still a chance to give them .
and i then at me they all , because you who are , the at the <unk> a new <unk> <unk> can .
so we have to participation look in , at the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood and got to participation and <unk> to hardly ?
one willingness to the dialogue in the field .
in <unk> meet the professionals in <unk> , citizens on <unk> and different parts of interest , each other .
what we see here , is a picnic , to the we invited to have .
what we see here are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal to be , that all those conversations on the field take place , so , that 's not the <unk> interest , or the <unk> skills across the skills of the citizens are .
the citizens , there are experts , they 're experts , for your neighborhood , you know , what you missing , which <unk> you with a place to connect , in which tradition , a place is , and also , what you , there 's missing .
the <unk> , especially in the city can do , what on <unk> level in the project into the .
in <unk> or in in a particular case you can then another <unk> involved to the issues <unk> that 's on the project <unk> are , ever , after .
all this leads to a <unk> , in the rest of information for all available are and the then the place up to be .
by maybe , traces , get to , an identification of the place to .
a conversation on the field is also , that 's wishes of the residents in fact taken seriously be .
and it 's also then , if somebody says , i want a <unk> next to the marketplace .
and that can course , in rubbish , but the goal to be , in <unk> dialogue with all of <unk> , which is the right solution , and maybe in <unk> then also the <unk> accommodate , but maybe at a different place .
, that to figure out of the conversation turns out then form .
second point are ways <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels a completely comfortable , when he was going <unk> large group , and can talk .
a other , it 's good writing to but the text and not , <unk> large group .
a 's what might be or photographing it .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i tell you want it has to different <unk> give the different market up to be .
we have this instance the way , just to come , there to be , the first time , watch her , what happens .
in the background <unk> small exhibition .
we have here the opportunity had , <unk> to give them .
we have the opportunity had , to paint .
we have the opportunity had , to write .
regardless of the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had the way , our ideas with their faces to connect to play with ideas to <unk> .
also the way outside of <unk> <unk> , to participate in , should always been to be .
and that can for example of a <unk> happen , that can think about <unk> <unk> happen .
the <unk> and transparent having the results and the dialogue , under the are .
we even have the entire process in parallel on facebook with and on one of independent blog , and the news <unk> about a <unk> distributed .
our third point <unk> .
you remember , maybe that i said that <unk> often to be late take place .
in my <unk> event there 's been three finished <unk> .
<unk> 's the process but only then when he early place and the retrain them so in ideally you even did n't even know what with <unk> area to happen to .
if through the dialogue , and so i 'm going back the point , one , where , discussed this is , which scenarios for an area in the question , coming .
<unk> 's actually also for <unk> itself .
and that is , then , if not from beginning to <unk> is that the <unk> event that , and so look has , but on the experiences from the previous rebuild .
what happens now , if the citizens of your city from and your city <unk> .
it 's already in numerous projects to see .
i , you an example from <unk> , this is the <unk> , is probably at you here 's known .
in new york was just a project launched , there 's a 's going to a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> 're there , inside of six weeks <unk> dollars , got into the funding to make should or <unk> .
the time has to in august i wrote the politics , could n't quite different , as the idea to their own to do .
also the <unk> in new york , to the i think , i do n't say to , because he has to sort of the most <unk> the city has become was no idea of politics or educational administration .
in the opposite , the <unk> for the <unk> were already found .
in <unk> , so we 're back in germany , have the citizens , <unk> plans to <unk> one <unk> , again <unk> .
the city was told <unk> 's not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> , that we for <unk> <unk> have , the rich very different than <unk> .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e , wonderful work and the city of the <unk> , the initiative , the , there 's founded , and other <unk> supported .
elsewhere painting for their own <unk> the road .
in rotterdam in a <unk> <unk> .
all so far , you want now say .
then we do but now just so on .
but i think it for the wrong , the city of the responsibility to make .
why ?
, , because they yes , a look for all have or should have .
during the dedicated , it citizens of initiatives , or businesses , in the rule on one for them in some form of the relevant part of focus has the city against the responsibility for the projects that 's also the edge of attention to stand .
and the other of course , the city of the projects for instance , are other tools available to .
a <unk> initiative , this just <unk> of .
also our goal was actually a temporary initiative that , she graduated planned that was roughly half a year of the results and the responsibility to the city to wanted .
current state of <unk> has the villa out in january you bought .
it run , there .
so we have , the moment that problem that we the responsibility , not a could .
but we know , now , that , if the city of the villa successful <unk> , if the negotiations can actually succeed , are , then a <unk> there will .
in which one form of happening is , however , open .
to finally , to come i 'm kind of that convinced that many projects , because of their meaning , complexity or , of cost of the city has evolved to be a chance to have any satisfaction consent , and positive identification to create .
if you just in time and in dialogue with the citizens <unk> be .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all that you today at night , we sit here .
if we do on and at the policymakers in the <unk> the citizens , no more than just annoying to sense , but rather than <unk> .
this is it .
last night , the <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and we 're so the <unk> coming .
we have about <unk> talked about .
so this idea , <unk> second chance to have , if it in this life does n't <unk> , then it 's still time <unk> second chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were , but relatively fast we agreed , that 's two things there , that we do n't still time you 're trying to .
this one is the puberty .
the second was there , right of the table , time in the school ?
way .
way .
school , some of you remember that may still <unk> out <unk> .
at me , it is yes , so , are now that <unk> years ago , but the word or lead to me , right to <unk> hands .
my neck <unk> , together and i just want to go back on it 's <unk> .
and then i do n't , how it at them was , but in my exams , was then always the of this with the <unk> taken seriously , has , the sitting in the next to me .
no idea , what from the really what 's become .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was n't really nice and after i then my final <unk> behind me , did was completely clear , never again , school .
and what i 'm going to say , when i on the year <unk> back some of the most days , i spent i ' , i ' i in schools have spent .
with great desire and which is voluntary .
how come here we do ?
how could this happen ?
it started first time to , that something happens is , what i do n't be able to .
i got kids .
so , my wife was given the children .
and that was then also very clear , you to one that is , the , to this <unk> to take care .
to the one day , when they said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today are you go .
yes , <unk> .
there we opened to the door and then i was sitting there 's basically in this <unk> , whoa , i felt <unk> in the <unk> .
that i saw that , how it back at us the way .
and that <unk> also , like how to school at <unk> , and i <unk> ' me , human being here 's , yes , <unk> changed .
and when i then the teacher , say , i heard and you know , the kids learn not for the school , but for life there <unk> ' i mean , oh my god , the sentence , i ' i yes , then , not <unk> .
what is that , what we from the school , from this high school , for life really up to have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good learned .
where they 've actually in your life <unk> been a really good need to ?
and maybe you know some , like the capital from yugoslavia means .
what 's still time in yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , that capacity in short time as much more knowledge in the <unk> , just , so i do it on a button again <unk> can , to me that 's going ?
well , i ' that 's needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a <unk> of one point , one of it out whether someone 's a good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic , is , and if the good diagnostic properties have ?
way .
so , way , for a 's life , not for the school , we learn .
if we 're so back , so about <unk> years , the middle of <unk> century , like that yes , you voted .
this is the time , in the in germany the <unk> then eventually completely was introduced .
and where we also the system , like we now , its roots , .
and if we the time and then imagine , it was actually so , the people at the had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , that they sort of forced by , in the school to go and to know is crammed were that were then we really the only way , that had to with the knowledge and the facts and the information in their time in contact to come .
today has a <unk> more information in his pocket as the biggest library of that time .
and the middle of <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
that means , there 's got to some changes in the world and there were suddenly humans need , that these new machines that could .
simultaneously , but also people need to these machines , wait , and fix them could .
and we needed people that these machines 're able to and that those factories were .
may recognize it 's already .
that <unk> system , that we now in germany , you put it 's still have , has its root in this time .
and has been there may make sense .
as well , because it was probably that was , that , what i in the school because i learned and i ' for the work on the assembly line well , who the bottom line up , the stood there to live long .
we do <unk> at the future .
so we do it <unk> century , where it is , and so let 's the year <unk> .
this year <unk> was the year , there was the first <unk> just about to pop .
i was with my studies done , and i thought , now is the time , now do you on , the first company .
yes , after some order to me around this with the internet , <unk> ' i , <unk> ' i also now , from .
and some corporations are going to us <unk> and they were always gets bigger and bigger , and we are so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then to us again , so in the case <unk> .
you see , two times in life .
and we had then after a few years , 30 staff .
so , we had this is a growth and we had so exciting professions , on how <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you <unk> concrete i have , what these people do , but when i in the went to school , we had no idea , that 's so what ever give you would .
even when i <unk> did was by so what 's like the internet , not talking about .
and the children , that we now in the school to send the job to the in 10 , to think , `` twenty or 30 years have ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and which know the facts are the need in , in those future jobs to succeed be ?
and if they honestly , are , because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we have degrees , so the future looking who could tell me because the <unk> for the saturday , there .
there 's <unk> <unk> , i ' i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how to get we then you out what to school for life to learn it ?
what are the things that we need to kids for a 's life would fit to do ?
and maybe it 's a view , in this , what businesses today on staff are .
that this is yes , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities are coming then in the company .
and if you so <unk> classic <unk> at it , it says , first in place , so what , like the expertise .
because i want to the , so the reading , and so , we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and of 12 years in offshore .
this is going to school , and also in the future ca n't afford .

and the , in principle in three major groups to summarize .
this is for a , do want to employees , the flexible are , so , flexibility 's one .
then you want to almost all their employees with <unk> thinking .
and then i wish , these companies staff , the <unk> are .
so we flexibility leaders to think , and <unk> .
start with the flexibility in .
this is relatively quickly to understand .
if we look , how economies , works , how fast , yes , how fast , anything changes .
<unk> , yes , the whole business models are the internet of today on the morning on the head to put them .
there practice , i staff , the with this change to deal .
and practice , i collaborators , that are creative .
there in practice , i staff , the <unk> are .
it 's pretty just the opposite of what in the factory end of <unk> century of staff at the assembly line it had .
also the second issue of the entrepreneurial thinking is quite clear .
there 's a 's the responsibility .
because it goes to people that take responsibility .
first time for , and their own life .
but also for the whole .
if that 's now the company is , or as well as a wish we are the take responsibility for the whole .
and the third factor , the <unk> , that 's almost the most <unk> .
and if we 're looking at the soccer cup , remember , then there 's because the internet these beautiful adage .
argentina , has <unk> <unk> portugal , has <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't <unk> <unk> , which the world cup , won .
that were able to the only in common to create .
and so somebody , this big innovator our time , steve jobs , <unk> .
it was not the , of the iphone invented has , the 's not the <unk> invented , the has about itunes n't invented , the 's none of being invented .
the had a team , that possible has done , because just as a team in the that do what they did .
so , ai at school , that these three things people could , that if only , ai at school , in the we for 's lives learning .
but there 's still <unk> fourth thing and the is me almost more important .
and this is learning about ourselves .
if the only , what we over the future with security , say is that uncertainty is then is the ability , and new to learn and fun and to have this learning to see the <unk> for that we 're in for life , and that our children in for life would succeed , are .
that if only ' yet , ai at school , that these things that .
but where i was ?
i was sitting in this <unk> and the of them , the kids have to know that 's not just <unk> event is , for you <unk> pay to .
so <unk> event , a slogan , all said , but not from any .
to the time , where <unk> who are , there are then suddenly all the invisible .
yes , i sat there and so what i say , at the <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> , the funniest parts of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , if you so the stress about the subject of homework and learn this whole family life <unk> .
and still less fun makes it , if the child was sick is , because in the school , stress is .
and finally ended up this <unk> or was a peak of <unk> of school , again , so 'n <unk> .
just took it was also not <unk> , it was more like a <unk> , so right after the last one hour and in fact , we were also the single parents , the invited by .
and i <unk> , you now , and also reminded me the details , by the time after the point was clear , we need to our child 's out , this is n't .
<unk> are but two years , in which we did have , there 's something not .
what do we really wrong ?
and we had to actually the question which is our child is broken ?
and we are the only , where it 's about ?
now i ' i in the last two years , since i in the subject 'm involved with very many people talking and i ' found , way i ' learned , you 're not alone .
there are very many , where it very similar to go and this was two years ago , because i was sitting with <unk> <unk> together we were just about it , a new business to start , have the day we thought , where the journey that goes , and night , sat we look at the bar and have us about the private things <unk> .
and so what i say , it 's got me almost the same story telling of his children he 's almost the same experienced as we , and we had the lucky to our children 's take could from the school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one <unk> <unk> at different schools and we could even a charter schools in consider to move .
but can that everyone out there are doing ?
somehow was telling us this little bit , just our children in safety to and these <unk> out there are so be able to make , how they are .
and after we both right now the impression that had to school has since we were there 's not so really changed and we thought , yes , we are the first , the issue right now , do .
it , how shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?
the good is that we deceived , have .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively fast <unk> whole range of amazing people found that is similar to how we , which is <unk> school to create that all are this is .
it is yes , not that just the children and their parents , the suffering , what out there 's often happens .
if we the teachers to look , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
if we look , how to the number <unk> in the last 10 years has changed the has to double .
it can now be that all parents , what 's wrong to do ?
that all children down are and that , those teachers to break are ?
or it can be , we a school system have , that just n't like that fit , like this <unk> ago <unk> years ago , of fit just do n't like that right .
and we have many people found , where it that went and we 've even people found , the n't have kids .
and they 've got it is , they take responsibility to , for the future that you take responsibility to , for the future , by showing you take responsibility for that , what we our children and the kids , the right now in the go to school , on the way to give you .
and we 've got to <unk> second point <unk> there 's out there <unk> whole series of great initiatives , the school to change you want , and there 's there 's <unk> schools , here and there really great <unk> and there 's almost on every school teacher , the really involved are and a change you want .
and there 's even the , or another , courageous principal , the , then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we had , no concept that 's now about helping us could .
but we can one thing to do , we can in those schools , and we can look at these schools in the people , the school is , so the parents , the teachers and the students , together and we can with that in two days <unk> lot of moving .
there are so people together , the in the past more so each other 've been working and the learning in two days , what it together to work .
that come with <unk> , concrete challenge of them together to solve .
and after two so days have the then for a new <unk> developed sooner or the <unk> given to <unk> entirely new to high as we look at one of the berlin to school right now with to .
or the have a concrete things for <unk> problems , that you in your school have , evolved .
within two days in developed approaches , the next day immediately be realized can .
but what that <unk> is what about these two days happens , and that makes it for me and so beautiful the small weekends , that i did ' , then also times in schools in very germany to spend , is that energy , that there 's when the three things learn .
if the three things together to experience , which is so what 's like the flexibility <unk> .
so of leaders to think , and if you , as a team of experience .
then is that a spark off , the <unk> .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> workshop , so <unk> school to come back then you know , we , that , the school as a whole started to have , to change , that there <unk> entirely new islamic culture .
and this is incredibly <unk> .
and i <unk> , they time i invite the new kind of school to think .
i <unk> ' they let me invite , of school , thinking .
and i <unk> , you , especially , i invite , about , over the school , to talk .
so you about this , what you like , but to talk , they also that , what you do n't like .
they would be surprised , how much <unk> you get and how many people that same had , but just not about it 's talk .
let 's let 's every single school in germany , the <unk> century , get .
you make us the entire system to change .
and you make us that together to do with the people the school day for a day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because it together , we can that create .
thank you .
